    "Sanskrit": "अर्जुन उवाच ।\nये शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य यजन्ते श्रद्धयान्विताः ।\nतेषां निष्ठा तु का कृष्ण सत्त्वमाहो रजस्तमः ॥ १॥",
    "Transliteration": "arjuna uvāca\nye śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya\nyajante śraddhayānvitāḥ\nteṣām nișthā tu kā kṛṣṇa\nsattvam āho rajas tamah",
    "Word_by_word": "arjunah uvāca—Arjuna said; ye—those; śāstra-vidhim—the regulations of scripture; utsṛjya—giving up; yajante—worships; śraddhayā—full faith; anvitāḥ—possessed of; teṣām—of them; nișthā—faith; tu—but; kā—what is that; kṛṣṇa—O Kṛṣṇa; sattvam—in goodness; āho—said; rajaḥ—in passion; tamaḥ—in ignorance.",
    "Translation": "Arjuna said, O Krsna, what is the situation of one who does not follow the principles of scripture but worships according to his own imagination? Is he in goodness, in passion or in ignorance?",
    "Purport": "In the Fourth Chapter, thirty-ninth verse, it is said that a person faithful to a particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of knowledge and attains the highest perfectional stage of peace and prosperity. In the Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not follow the principles laid down in the scriptures is called an asura, demon, and one who follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva, or demigod. Now, if one, with faith, follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna is to be cleared by Krsna. Are those who create some sort of God by selecting a human being and placing their faith in him worshiping in goodness, passion or ignorance? Do such persons attain the perfectional stage of life? Is it possible for them to be situated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional stage? Do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures but who have faith in something and worship gods and demigods and men attain success in their effort? Arjuna is putting these questions to Krsna."
