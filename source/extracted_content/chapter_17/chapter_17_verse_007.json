    "Sanskrit": "आहारस्त्वपि सर्वस्य त्रिविधो भवति प्रियः ।\nयज्ञस्तपस्तथा दानं तेषां भेदमिमं शृणु ॥ ७ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "āhāras tv api sarvasya\ntri-vidho bhavati priyaḥ\nyajñas tapas tathā dānam\nteṣāṁ bhedam imam śṛṇu",
    "Word_by_word": "āhārah—eating; tu—certainly; api—also; sarvasya—of everyone; trividhaḥ—three kinds; bhavati—there are; priyaḥ—dear; yajñaḥ—sacrifice; tapaḥ—austerity; tathā—also; dānam—charity; teṣām—of them; bhedam—differences; imam—thus; śṛṇu—hear.",
    "Translation": "Even food of which all partake is of three kinds, according to the three modes of material nature. The same is true of sacrifices, austerities and charity. Listen, and I shall tell you of the distinctions of these.",
    "Purport": "In terms of different situations and the modes of material nature, there are differences in the manner of eating, performing sacrifices, austerities and charities. They are not all conducted on the same level. Those who can understand analytically what kind of performances are in what modes of material nature are actually wise; those who consider all kinds of sacrifice or foods or charity to be the same cannot discriminate, and they are foolish. There are missionary workers who advocate that one can do whatever he likes and attain perfection. But these foolish guides are not acting according to the direction of the scripture. They are manufacturing ways and misleading the people in general."
