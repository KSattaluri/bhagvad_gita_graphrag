    "Word_by_word": "deva—the Supreme Lord; dvija—the brāhmaṇa; guru—the spiritual master;\nprājña—worshipable personalities; pūjanam—worship; śaucam—cleanliness;\nārjavam—simplicity; brahma-caryam—celibacy; ahimsā—nonviolence; ca—\nalso; śārīram—pertaining to the body; tapaḥ—austerity; ucyate—is said to be.",
    "Translation": "The austerity of the body consists in this: worship of the Supreme Lord, the\nbrāhmaņas, the spiritual master, and superiors like the father and mother.\nCleanliness, simplicity, celibacy and nonviolence are also austerities of the body.",
    "Purport": "The Supreme Godhead here explains the different kinds of austerity and\npenance. First He explains the austerities and penances practiced by the body.\nOne should offer, or learn to offer, respect to God or to the demigods, the\nperfect, qualified brāhmaṇas and the spiritual master and superiors like father,\nmother or any person who is conversant with Vedic knowledge. These should\nbe given proper respect. One should practice cleansing oneself externally and\ninternally, and he should learn to become simple in behavior. He should not\ndo anything which is not sanctioned by the scriptural injunction. He should\nnot indulge in sex outside of married life, for sex is sanctioned in the scripture\nonly in marriage, not otherwise. This is called celibacy. These are penances\nand austerities as far as the body is concerned."
