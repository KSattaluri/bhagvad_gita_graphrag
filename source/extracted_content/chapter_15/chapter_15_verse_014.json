    "Sanskrit": "अहं वैश्वानरो भूत्वा प्राणिनां देहमाश्रितः ।\nप्राणापानसमायुक्तः पचाम्यन्नं चतुर्विधम् ॥ १४ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "aham vaiśvānaro bhūtvā\nprāṇinām deham āśritaḥ\nprāṇāpāna-samāyuktah\npacāmy annam catur-vidham",
    "Word_by_word": "aham—I; vaiśvānarah—by My plenary portion as the digesting fire; bhūtvā—becoming; prāṇinām—of all living entities; deham—body; āśritaḥ—situated; prāṇa—outgoing air; apāna—downgoing air; samāyuktah—keep balance; pacāmi—digest; annam—foodstuff; catur-vidham—four kinds of.",
    "Translation": "I am the fire of digestion in every living body, and I am the air of life, outgoing and incoming, by which I digest the four kinds of foodstuff.",
    "Purport": "According to Ayur-vedic śāstra, we understand that there is a fire in the stomach which digests all food sent there. When the fire is not blazing, there is no hunger, and when the fire is in order, we become hungry. Sometimes when the fire is not going nicely, treatment is required. In any case, this fire is representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic mantras also confirm that the Supreme Lord or Brahman is situated in the form of fire within the stomach and is digesting all kinds of foodstuff. Therefore since He is helping the digestion of all kinds of foodstuff, the living entity is not independant in the eating process. Unless the Supreme Lord helps him in digesting, there is no possibility of eating. He thus produces and digests foodstuff, and, by His grace, we are enjoying life. In the Vedānta-sūtra this is also confirmed: śabdādibhyo 'ntaḥ pratiṣṭhānāc ca. The Lord is situated within sound and within the body, within the air and even within the stomach as the digestive force. There are four kinds of foodstuff: some are swallowed, some are chewed, some are licked up, and some are sucked, and He is the digestive force for all of them."
