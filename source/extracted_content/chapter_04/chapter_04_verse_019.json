    "Sanskrit": "यस्य सर्वे समारम्भाः कामसङ्कल्पवर्जिताः ।\nज्ञानाग्निदग्धकर्माणं तमाहुः पण्डितं बुधाः ॥ १९ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "yasya sarve samārambhāḥ\nkāma-sankalpa-varjitāḥ\njñānāgni-dagdha-karmāņam\ntam āhuḥ panditam budhāh",
    "Word_by_word": "yasya—one whose; sarve—all sorts of; samārambhāḥ—in all attempts; kāma—desire for sense gratification; sankalpa—determination; varjitāḥ—are devoid of; jñāna—of perfect knowledge; āgni—fire; dagdha—being burnt by; karmāņam—the performer; tam—him; āhuḥ—declare; paṇḍitam—learned; budhāḥ—those who know.",
    "Translation": "One is understood to be in full knowledge whose every act is devoid of desire for sense gratification. He is said by sages to be a worker whose fruitive action is burned up by the fire of perfect knowledge.",
    "Purport": "Only a person in full knowledge can understand the activities of a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Because the person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is devoid of all kinds of sense-gratificatory propensities, it is to be understood that he has burned up the reactions of his work by perfect knowledge of his constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is actually learned who has attained to such perfection of knowledge.\nDevelopment of this knowledge of the eternal servitorship of the Lord is compared to fire. Such a fire, once kindled, can burn up all kinds of reactions to work."
