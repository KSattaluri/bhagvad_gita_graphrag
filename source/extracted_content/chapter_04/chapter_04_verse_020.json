    "Sanskrit": "त्यक्त्वा कर्मफलासङ्गं नित्यतृप्तो निराश्रयः ।\nकर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपि नैव किञ्चित्करोति सः ॥ २० ॥",
    "Transliteration": "tyaktvā karma-phalāsangam\nnitya-trpto nirāśrayaḥ\nkarmany abhipravṛtto 'pi\nnaiva kiñcit karoti sah",
    "Word_by_word": "tyaktvā—having given up; karma-phala-āsangam—attachment for fruitive results; nitya—always; tṛptaḥ—being satisfied; nirāśrayaḥ—without any center; karmaṇi—in activity; abhipravṛttaḥ—being fully engaged; api—in spite of; na—does not; eva—certainly; kiñcit—anything; karoti—do; saḥ—he.",
    "Translation": "Abandoning all attachment to the results of his activities, ever satisfied and independant, he performs no fruitive action, although engaged in all kinds of undertakings.",
    "Purport": "This freedom from the bondage of actions is possible only in Krsna consciousness when one is doing everything for Krsna. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person acts out of pure love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he has no attraction for the results of the action. He is not even attached to his personal maintenance, for everything is left to Krsna. Nor is he anxious to secure things, nor to protect things already in his possession. He does his duty to his best ability and leaves everything to Krsna. Such an unattached person is always free from the resultant reactions of good and bad; it is as though he were not doing anything. This is the sign of akarma, or actions without fruitive reactions. Any other action, therefore, devoid of Krsna consciousness, is binding upon the worker, and that is the real aspect of vikarma, as explained hereinbefore."
