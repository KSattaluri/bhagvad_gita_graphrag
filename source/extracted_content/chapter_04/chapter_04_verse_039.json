    "Purport": "Such knowledge in Krsna consciousness can be achieved by a faithful person who believes firmly in Krsna. One is called a faithful man who thinks that, simply by acting in Krsna consciousness, he can attain the highest perfection. This faith is attained by the discharge of devotional service, and by chanting \"Hare Krșņa, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krșņa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare,\" which cleanses one's heart of all material dirt. Over and above this, one should control the senses. A person who is faithful to Krsna and who controls the senses can easily attain perfection in the knowledge of Krsna consciousness without delay."
