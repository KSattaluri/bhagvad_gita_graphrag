    "Sanskrit": "स निश्चयेन योक्तव्यो योगोऽनिर्विणचेतसा ।\nसङ्कल्पप्रभवान्कामांस्त्यक्त्वा सर्वानशेषतः ।\nमनसैवेन्द्रियग्रामं विनियम्य समन्ततः ॥ २४ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "sa niścayena yoktavyo\nyogo 'nirvinna-cetasā\nsankalpa-prabhavān kāmāms\ntyaktvā sarvān aśeṣataḥ\nmanasaivendriya-grāmam\nviniyamya samantatah",
    "Word_by_word": "saḥ—that yoga system; niścayena—with firm determination; yoktavyaḥ—must\nbe practiced; yogaḥ—in such practice; anirviṇṇa-cetasā—without deviation;\nsaṅkalpa—material desires; prabhavān—born of; kāmān—sense gratification;\ntyaktvā—giving up; sarvān—all; aśeṣataḥ—completely; manasā—by the mind;\neva—certainly; indriya-grāmam—the full set of senses; viniyamya—regulating;\nsamantataḥ—from all sides.",
    "Translation": "One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with undeviating\ndetermination and faith. One should abandon, without exception, all material\ndesires born of false ego and thus control all the senses on all sides by the mind.",
    "Purport": "The yoga practitioner should be determined and should patiently prosecute\nthe practice without deviation. One should be sure of success at the end and\npursue this course with great perserverance, not becoming discouraged if there\nis any delay in the attainment of success. Success is sure for the rigid\npractitioner. Regarding bhakti-yoga, Rupa Gosvāmī says:\n\nutsāhān niścayād dhairyāt tat tat karma-pravartanāt\nsaṅga-tyāgāt satovṛtteḥ sadbhir bhaktih prasidhyati\n\n\"The process of bhakti-yoga can be executed successfully with full-hearted\nenthusiasm, perseverance, and determination by following the prescribed\nduties in the association of devotees and by engaging completely in activities\nof goodness.\"\nAs for determination, one should follow the example of the sparrow who\nlost her eggs in the waves of the ocean. A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of\nthe ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow\nbecame very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not\neven consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She\nbegan to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for\nher impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last\nGaruda, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Visņu, heard it. He became\ncompassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow.\nGaruda was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he\npromised to help. Thus Garuda at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest\nhe himself take up the work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this,\nand returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of\nGaruda.\nSimilarly, the practice of yoga, especially bhakti-yoga in Kṛṣṇa consciousness,\nmay appear to be a very difficult job. But if anyone follows the principles with\ngreat determination, the Lord will surely help, for God helps those who help\nthemselves."
