    "Sanskrit": "जितात्मनः प्रशान्तस्य परमात्मा समाहितः । शीतोष्णसुखदुःखेषु तथा मानापमानयोः ॥ ७ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "jitātmanaḥ praśāntasya paramātmā samāhitaḥ | śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkheṣu tathā mānāpamānayoḥ || 7 ||",
    "Word_by_word": "jita-ātmanaḥ — of one who has conquered his mind; praśāntasya — of one who has attained tranquility by such control over the mind; paramātmā — the Supersoul; samāhitaḥ — approached completely; śīta — cold; uṣṇa — heat; sukha — in happiness; duḥkheṣu — in distress; tathā — also; māna — honor; apamānayoḥ — in dishonor.",
    "Translation": "For one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for he has attained tranquility. To such a man happiness and distress, heat and cold, honor and dishonor are all the same.",
    "Purport": "Actually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone's heart as Paramātmā. When the mind is misled by the external illusory energy, one becomes entangled in material activities. Therefore, as soon as one's mind is controlled through one of the yoga systems, one is to be considered as having already reached the destination. One has to abide by superior dictation. When one's mind is fixed on the superior nature, he has no other alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the Paramātmā or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence, namely distress and happiness, cold and heat, etc. This state is practical samādhi, or absorption in the Supreme."
