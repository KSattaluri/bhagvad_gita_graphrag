    "Sanskrit": "बहिरन्तश्च भूतानामचरं चरमेव च ।\nसूक्ष्मत्वात्तदविज्ञेयं दूरस्थं चान्तिके च तत् ॥ १६ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "bahir antaś ca bhūtānām\nacaram caram eva ca\nsūkṣmatvāt tad avijñeyam\ndūra-stham cāntike ca tat",
    "Word_by_word": "bahih—outside; antah—inside; ca—also; bhūtānām—of all living entities;\nacaram—not moving; caram—moving; eva—also; ca—and; sūkṣmatvāt—on\naccount of being subtle; tat—that; avijñeyam—unknowable; dūrastham—far\naway; ca antike—near also; ca—and; tat—that.",
    "Translation": "The Supreme Truth exists both internally and externally, in the moving and\nnonmoving. He is beyond the power of the material senses to see or to know.\nAlthough far, far away, He is also near to all.",
    "Purport": "In Vedic literature we understand that Nārāyaņa, the Supreme Person, is\nresiding both outside and inside of every living entity. He is present both in\nthe spiritual and material world. Although He is far, far away, still He is near\nto us. These are the statements of Vedic literature. Āsīno dūraṁ vrajati śayāno\nyāti sarvatah. And, because He is always engaged in transcendental bliss, we\ncannot understand how He is enjoying His full opulence. We cannot see or\nunderstand with these material senses. Therefore in the Vedic language it is\nsaid that to understand Him our material mind and senses cannot act. But one\nwho has purified his mind and senses by practicing Krsna consciousness in\ndevotional service can see Him constantly. It is confirmed in Brahmā-samhitā\nthat the devotee who has developed love for the Supreme God can see Him\nalways, without cessation. And it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gītā (11.54) that He\ncan be seen and understood only by devotional service. Bhaktyā tvananyayā\nśakyah."
