    "Sanskrit": "अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जनाः पर्युपासते\nतेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् ॥ २२ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "ananyāś cintayanto māṁ\nye janāḥ paryupāsate\nteṣām nityābhiyuktānām\nyoga-kṣemam vahāmy aham",
    "Word_by_word": "ananyāḥ—no other; cintayantaḥ—concentrating; mām—unto Me; ye—who; janāḥ—persons; paryupāsate—properly worship; teṣām—their; nitya—always; abhiyuktānām—fixed in devotion; yoga-kṣemam—requirements; vahāmi—carry; aham—I.",
    "Translation": "But those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendental form—to them I carry what they lack and preserve what they have.",
    "Purport": "One who is unable to live for a moment without Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot but think of Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours, being engaged in devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, rendering other services, cultivating friendship and surrendering fully to the Lord. Such activities are all auspicious and full of spiritual potencies; indeed, they make the devotee perfect in self-realization. Then his only desire is to achieve the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called yoga. By the mercy of the Lord, such a devotee never comes back to this material condition of life. Kṣema refers to the merciful protection of the Lord. The Lord helps the devotee to achieve Kṛṣṇa consciousness by yoga, and when he becomes fully Kṛṣṇa conscious the Lord protects him from falling down to a miserable conditioned life."
