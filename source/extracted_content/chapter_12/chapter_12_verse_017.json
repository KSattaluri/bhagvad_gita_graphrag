    "Sanskrit": "यो न हृष्यति न द्वेष्टि न शोचति न का‌ङ्क्षति ।\nशुभाशुभपरित्यागी भक्तिमान्यः स मे प्रियः ॥ १७ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "yo na hrṣyati na dveṣṭi\nna śocati na kāṅkṣati\nśubhāśubha-parityāgī\nbhaktimān yaḥ sa me priyaḥ",
    "Word_by_word": "yaḥ—one who: na—never; hṛṣyati—takes pleasure; na—never; dveṣṭi—grieves; na—never; śocati—laments; na—never; kāṅkṣati—desires; śubha—auspicious; aśubha—inauspicious; parityāgī—renouncer; bhaktimān—devotee; yaḥ—one who; saḥ—he is; me—My; priyaḥ—dear.",
    "Translation": "One who neither grasps pleasure or grief, who neither laments nor desires, and who renounces both auspicious and inauspicious things, is very dear to Me.",
    "Purport": "A pure devotee is neither happy nor distressed over material gain and loss, nor is he very much anxious to get a son or disciple, nor is he distressed by not getting them. If he loses anything which is very dear to him, he does not lament. Similarly, if he does not get what he desires, he is not distressed. He is transcendental in the face of all kinds of auspicious, inauspicious and sinful activities. He is prepared to accept all kinds of risks for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is an impediment in the discharge of his devotional service. Such a devotee is very dear to Kṛṣṇa."
