    "Sanskrit": "मय्येव मन आधत्स्व मयि बुद्धिं निवेशय ।\nनिवसिष्यसि मय्येव अत ऊर्ध्वं न संशयः ॥ ८ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "mayy eva mana ādhatsva\nmayi buddhim niveśaya |\nnivasisyasi mayy eva\nata ūrdhvam na saṁśayaḥ || 8 ||",
    "Word_by_word": "mayi — unto Me; eva — certainly; manaḥ — mind; ādhatsva — fix; mayi — upon Me; buddhim — intelligence; niveśaya — apply; nivasisyasi — you live; mayi — unto Me; eva — certainly; ataḥ — therefore; ūrdhvam — up; na — never; saṁśayaḥ — doubt.",
    "Translation": "Just fix your mind upon Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and engage all your intelligence in Me. Thus you will live in Me always, without a doubt.",
    "Purport": "One who is engaged in Lord Krsna's devotional service lives in a direct relationship with the Supreme Lord, so there is no doubt that his position is transcendental from the very beginning. A devotee does not live on the material plane—he lives in Krsna. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent; therefore when a devotee chants Hare Krsna, Krsna and His internal potency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee. When he offers Krsna food, Krsna directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes Krsna-ized by eating the remnants. One who does not engage in such service cannot understand how this is so, although this is a process recommended in the Gītā and in other Vedic literatures."
