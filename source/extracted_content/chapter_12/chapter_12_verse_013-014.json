    "Sanskrit": "अद्वेष्टा सर्वभूतानां मैत्रः करुण एव च ।\nनिर्ममो निरहङ्कारः समदुःखसुखः क्षमी ॥ १३ ॥\nसन्तुष्टः सततं योगी यतात्मा दृढनिश्चयः ।\nमय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्यो मद्भक्तः स मे प्रियः ॥ १४ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "adveṣṭā sarva-bhūtānām\nmaitraḥ karuṇa eva ca\nnirmamo nirahaṅkāraḥ\nsama-duḥkha-sukhaḥ kṣamī\nsantuṣṭaḥ satataṁ yogī\nyatātmā dṛḍha-niścayaḥ\nmayy arpita-mano-buddhir\nyo mad-bhaktaḥ sa me priyaḥ",
    "Word_by_word": "adveṣṭā—not envious; sarva-bhūtānām—for all living entities; maitraḥ—\nfriendly; karuṇaḥ—kindly; eva—certainly; ca—also; nirmamaḥ—with no\nsense of proprietorship; nirahaṅkāraḥ—without false ego; sama—equally;\nduḥkhaḥ—distress; sukhaḥ—happiness; kṣamī—forgiving; santuṣṭaḥ—\nsatisfied; satatam—satisfied; yogī—engaged in devotion; yata-ātmā—\nendeavoring; dṛḍha-niścayaḥ—with determination; mayi—upon Me; arpita—\nengaged; manaḥ—mind; buddhiḥ—intelligent; yaḥ—one who; mat-bhaktaḥ—\nMy devotee; saḥ me priyaḥ—he is dear to Me.",
    "Translation": "One who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who does\nnot think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego and equal both in\nhappiness and distress, who is always satisfied and engaged in devotional service\nwith determination and whose mind and intelligence are in agreement with Me\n—he is very dear to Me.",
    "Purport": "Coming again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is describing\nthe transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses. A pure\ndevotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone.\nNor does a devotee become his enemy's enemy; he thinks that one is acting as\nhis enemy due to his own past misdeeds. Thus it is better to suffer than to\nprotest. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is stated: tat te 'nukampām su-\nsamīkṣyamāṇo. Whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty,\nhe thinks that it is the Lord's mercy upon him. He thinks: \"Thanks to my past\nmisdeeds I should suffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the\nmercy of the Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due.\nI am just getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead.\" Therefore he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many\ndistressful conditions. A devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his\nenemy. Nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to\nthe peace and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well\nthat he is not the material body. He does not identify with the body; therefore\nhe is freed from the conception of false ego and is equiposed both in happiness\nand distress. He is tolerant, and he is satisfied with whatever comes by the\ngrace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor much to achieve something\nwith great difficulty; therefore he is always joyful. He is a completely perfect\nmystic because he is fixed in the instructions received from the spiritual\nmaster, and because his senses are controlled, he is determined. He is not\nswayed by false argument because no one can lead him from the fixed\ndetermination of devotional service. He is fully conscious that Kṛṣṇa is the\neternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All his qualifications enable him to\ndepend entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a standard of devotional service is\nundoubtably very rare, but a devotee becomes situated in that stage by\nfollowing the regulative principles of devotional service. Furthermore, the\nLord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for the Lord is always\npleased with all his activities in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness."
