    "Sanskrit": "सक्ताः कर्मण्यविद्वांसो यथा कुर्वन्ति भारत ।\nकुर्याद्विद्वांस्तथासक्तश्चिकीर्षुर्लोकसङ्ग्रहम् ॥ २५ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "saktāḥ karmany avidvāmso\nyathā kurvanti bhārata\nkuryād vidvāms tathāsaktaś\ncikīrșur loka-sangraham",
    "Word_by_word": "saktāḥ—being attached; karmaņi—prescribed duties; avidvāmsah—the ignorant; yathā—as much as; kurvanti—do it; bhārata—O descendant of Bharata; kuryāt—must do; vidvān—the learned; tathā—thus; asaktah—without attachment; cikīrșuh—desiring to; loka-sangraham—leading the people in general.",
    "Translation": "As the ignorant perform their duties with attachment to results, similarly the learned may also act, but without attachment, for the sake of leading people on the right path.",
    "Purport": "A person in Krsna consciousness and a person not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are differentiated by different desires. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person does not do anything which is not conducive to development of Krsna consciousness. He may even act exactly like the ignorant person, who is too much attached to material activities, but one is engaged in such activities for the satisfaction of his sense gratification, whereas the other is engaged for the satisfaction of Krsna. Therefore, the Krsna conscious person is required to show the people how to act and how to engage the results of action for the purpose of Krsna"
