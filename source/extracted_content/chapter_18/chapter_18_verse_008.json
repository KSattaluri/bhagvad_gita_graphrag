    "Word_by_word": "duhkham—unhappy; iti—thus; eva—certainly; yat—that which; karma—\nwork; kāya—body; kleśa—troublesome; bhayāt—out of; tyajet—fear; sah—\nthat; kṛtvā—after doing; rājasam—in the mode of passion; tyāgam—\nrenunciation; na eva—certainly not; tyāga—renounced; phalam—results;\nlabhet—gain.",
    "Translation": "Anyone who gives up prescribed duties as troublesome, or out of fear, is said to be in the mode of passion. Such action never leads to the elevation of renunciation.",
    "Purport": "One who is in Krsna consciousness should not give up earning money out\nof fear that he is performing fruitive activities. If by working one can engage\nhis money in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or if by rising early in the morning one can\nadvance his transcendental Krsna consciousness, one should not desist out of\nfear or because such activities are considered troublesome. Such renunciation\nis in the mode of passion. The result of passionate work is always miserable.\nEven if a person renounces work in that spirit, he never gets the result of\nrenunciation."
