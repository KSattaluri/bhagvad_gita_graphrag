    "Sanskrit": "प्रवृत्तिं च निवृत्तिं च कार्याकार्ये भयाभये ।\nबन्धं मोक्षं च या वेत्ति बुद्धिः सा पार्थ सात्त्विकी ॥ ३० ॥",
    "Transliteration": "pravṛttim ca nivṛttim ca\nkāryākārye bhayābhaye\nbandham mokṣaṁ ca yā vetti\nbuddhiḥ sā pārtha sāttvikī",
    "Word_by_word": "pravrttim—deserving; ca—also; nivṛttim—not deserving; kārya—work; akārye—reaction; bhaya—fearful; abhaye—fearlessness; bandham—obligation; mokṣam ca—and liberation; yā—that which; vetti—knows; buddhiḥ—understanding; sā—that; pārtha—O son of Pṛthā; sāttvikī—in the mode of goodness.",
    "Translation": "O son of Pṛthā, that understanding by which one knows what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, what is to be feared and what is not to be feared, what is binding and what is liberating, that understanding is established in the mode of goodness.",
    "Purport": "Actions which are performed in terms of the directions of the scriptures are called pravrtti, or actions that deserve to be performed, and actions which are not so directed are not to be performed. One who does not know the scriptural directions becomes entangled in the actions and reactions of work. Understanding which discriminates by intelligence is situated in the mode of goodness."
