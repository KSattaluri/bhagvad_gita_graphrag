    "Sanskrit": "य इदं परमं गुह्यं मद्भक्तेष्वभिधास्यति ।\nभक्तिं मयि परां कृत्वा मामेवैष्यत्यसंशयः ॥ ६८ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ\nmad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati |\nbhaktiṁ mayi parāṁ kṛtvā\nmām evaiṣyaty asaṁśayaḥ || 68 ||",
    "Word_by_word": "yaḥ—anyone; idam—this; paramam—most; guhyam—confidential; mat—Mine; bhakteṣu—amongst devotees of; abhidhāsyati—explains; bhaktim—devotional service; mayi—unto Me; parām—transcendental; kṛtvā—having done; mām—unto Me; eva—certainly; eṣyati—comes; asaṁśayaḥ—without doubt.",
    "Translation": "For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.",
    "Purport": "Generally it is advised that Bhagavad-gītā be discussed amongst the devotees only, for those who are not devotees will neither understand Kṛṣṇa nor Bhagavad-gītā. Those who do not accept Kṛṣṇa as He is and Bhagavad-gītā as it is should not try to explain Bhagavad-gītā whimsically and become offenders. Bhagavad-gītā should be explained to persons who are ready to accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is a subject matter for the devotees only and not for philosophical speculators. Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to present Bhagavad-gītā as it is will advance in devotional activities and reach the pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to Godhead."
