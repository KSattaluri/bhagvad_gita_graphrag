    "Sanskrit": "नियतस्य तु सन्न्यासः कर्मणो नोपपद्यते ।\nमोहात्तस्य परित्यागस्तामसः परिकीर्तितः ॥ ७ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "niyatasya tu sannyāsaḥ\nkarmaņo nopapadyate\nmohāt tasya parityāgas\ntāmasaḥ parikīrtitah",
    "Word_by_word": "niyatasya—prescribed duties; tu—but; sannyāsaḥ—renunciation; karmaṇaḥ—\nactivities; na—never; upapadyate—is deserved; mohāt—by illusion; tasya—of\nwhich; parityāgaḥ—renunciation; tāmasaḥ—in the mode of ignorance;\nparikīrtitaḥ—declared.",
    "Translation": "Prescribed duties should never be renounced. If, by illusion, one gives up his\nprescribed duties, such renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance.",
    "Purport": "Work for material satisfaction must be given up, but activities which\npromote one to spiritual activity, like cooking for the Supreme Lord and\noffering the food to the Lord and then accepting the food, are recommended.\nIt is said that a person in the renounced order of life should not cook for\nhimself. Cooking for oneself is prohibited, but cooking for the Supreme Lord is\nnot prohibited. Similarly, a sannyāsī may perform a marriage ceremony to help\nhis disciple in the advancement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If one renounces such\nactivities, it is to be understood that he is acting in the mode of darkness."
