    "Word_by_word": "tyājyam—must be given up; doșavat—as an evil; iti—thus; eke—one group;\nkarma—work; prāhuḥ—said; manīșiņah—of great thinkers; yajña—sacrifice;\ndāna—charity; tapah—penance; karma—work; na—never; tyājyam—is to be\ngiven up; iti—thus; ca—certainly; apare—others.",
    "Translation": "Some learned men declare that all kinds of fruitive activities should be given up,\nbut there are yet other sages who maintain that acts of sacrifice, charity and\npenance should never be abandoned.",
    "Purport": "There are many activities in the Vedic literatures which are subjects of\ncontention. For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a sacrifice,\nyet some maintain animal killing is completely abominable. Although animal\nkilling in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal is not\nconsidered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal.\nSometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the\nsacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human\nform of life. But there are different opinions among the sages. Some say that\nanimal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a specific\nsacrifice it is good. All these different opinions on sacrificial activity are now\nbeing clarified by the Lord Himself."
