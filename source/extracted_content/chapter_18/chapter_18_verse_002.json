    "Sanskrit": "काम्यानां कर्मणां न्यासं सन्न्यासं कवयो विदुः ।\nसर्वकर्मफलत्यागं प्राहुस्त्यागं विचक्षणाः ॥ २ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "kāmyānām karmaṇāṁ nyāsam\nsannyāsam kavayo viduh\nsarva-karma-phala-tyāgam\nprāhus tyāgam vicakṣaṇāḥ",
    "Word_by_word": "śrī bhagavān uvāca—the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; kāmyānām—with desire; karmaṇām—activities; nyāsam—renunciation; sannyāsam—renounced order of life; kavayaḥ—the learned; viduḥ—know; sarva—all; karma—activities; phala—of results; tyāgam—renunciation; prāhuḥ—call; tyāgam—renunciation; vicakṣaṇāḥ—the experienced.",
    "Translation": "The Supreme Lord said, To give up the results of all activities is called renunciation [tyāga] by the wise. And that state is called the renounced order of life [sannyāsa] by great learned men.",
    "Purport": "The performance of activities for results has to be given up. This is the instruction of Bhagavad-gītā. But activities leading to advanced spiritual knowledge are not to be given up. This will be made clear in the next verse. There are many prescriptions of methods for performing sacrifice for some particular purpose in the Vedic literatures. There are certain sacrifices to perform to attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets, but sacrifices prompted by desires should be stopped. However, sacrifice for the purification of one's heart or for advancement in the spiritual science should not be given up."
