    "Sanskrit": "कार्यमित्येव यत्कर्म नियतं क्रियतेऽर्जुन ।\nसङ्गं त्यक्ता फलं चैव स त्यागः सात्त्विको मतः ॥ ९ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "kāryam ity eva yat karma\nniyatam kriyate 'rjuna\nsangam tyaktvā phalam caiva\nsa tyāgaḥ sāttviko matah",
    "Word_by_word": "kāryam—must be done; iti—thus; eva—thus; yat—that which; karma—work; niyatam—prescribed; kriyate—performed; arjuna—O Arjuna; saṅgam—association; tyaktvā—giving up; phalam—result; ca—also; eva—certainly; saḥ—that; tyāgaḥ—renunciation; sāttvikaḥ—in the mode of goodness; mataḥ—in My opinion.",
    "Translation": "But he who performs his prescribed duty only because it ought to be done, and renounces all attachment to the fruit—his renunciation is of the nature of goodness, O Arjuna.",
    "Purport": "Prescribed duties must be performed with this mentality. One should act without attachment for the result; he should be disassociated from the modes of work. A man working in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in a factory does not associate himself with the work of the factory, nor with the workers of the factory. He simply works for Kṛṣṇa. And when he gives up the result for Kṛṣṇa, he is acting transcendentally."
