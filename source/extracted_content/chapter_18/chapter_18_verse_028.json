    "Sanskrit": "अयुक्तः प्राकृतः स्तब्धः शठो नैष्कृतिकोऽलसः । विषादी दीर्घसूत्री च कर्ता तामस उच्यते ॥ २८ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "ayuktaḥ prākṛtaḥ stabdhaḥ śaṭho naiṣkṛtiko ’lasaḥ |\nviṣādī dīrgha-sūtrī ca kartā tāmasa ucyate || 28 ||",
    "Word_by_word": "ayuktaḥ—without reference to the scriptural injunctions; prākṛtaḥ—materialistic; stabdhaḥ—obstinate; śaṭhaḥ—deceitful; naiṣkṛtikaḥ—expert in insulting others; alasaḥ—lazy; viṣādī—morose; dīrgha-sūtrī—procrastinating; ca—also; kartā—worker; tāmasaḥ—in the mode of ignorance; ucyate—is said to be.",
    "Translation": "And that worker who is always engaged in work against the injunction of the scripture, who is materialistic, obstinate, cheating and expert in insulting others, who is lazy, always morose and procrastinating, is a worker in the mode of ignorance.",
    "Purport": "In the scriptural injunctions we find what sort of work should be performed and what sort of work should not be performed. Those who do not care for those injunctions engage in work not to be done, and such persons are generally materialistic. They work according to the modes of nature, not according to the injunctions of the scripture. Such workers are not very gentle, and generally they are always cunning and expert in insulting others. They are very lazy; even though they have some duty, they do not do it properly, and they put it aside to be done later on. Therefore they appear to be morose. They procrastinate; anything which can be done in an hour they drag on for years. Such workers are situated in the mode of ignorance."
