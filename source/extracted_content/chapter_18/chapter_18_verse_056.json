    "Transliteration": "sarva-karmāṇy api sadā\nkurvāņo mad-vyapāśrayah\nmat-prasādād avāpnoti\nśāśvatam padam avyayam",
    "Word_by_word": "sarva—all; karmāņi—activities; api—although; sadā—always; kurvāṇaḥ—\nperforming; mat—under My; vyapāśrayah—protection; mat—My; prasādāt—\nmercy; avāpnoti—achieves; śāśvatam—eternal; padam—abode; avyayam—\nimperishable.",
    "Translation": "Though engaged in all kinds of activities, My devotee, under My protection,\nreaches the eternal and imperishable abode by My grace.",
    "Purport": "The word mad-vyapāśrayah means under the protection of the Supreme\nLord. To be free from material contamination, a pure devotee acts under the\ndirection of the Supreme Lord or His representative, the spiritual master.\nThere is no time limitation for a pure devotee. He is always, twenty-four hours,\none hundred percent engaged in activities under the direction of the Supreme\nLord. To a devotee who is thus engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness the Lord is\nvery, very kind. In spite of all difficulties, he is eventually placed in the\ntranscendental abode, or Kṛṣṇaloka. He is guaranteed entrance there; there is\nno doubt about it. In that supreme abode, there is no change; everything is\neternal, imperishable and full of knowledge."
