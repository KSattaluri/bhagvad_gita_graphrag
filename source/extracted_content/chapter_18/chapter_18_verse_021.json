    "Sanskrit": "पृथक्वेन तु यज्ज्ञानं नानाभावान्पृथग्विधान् ।\nवेत्ति सर्वेषु भूतेषु तज्ज्ञानं विद्धि राजसम् ॥ २१ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "prthaktvena tu yaj jñānaṁ\nnānā-bhāvān prthag-vidhān\nvetti sarveṣu bhūteșu\ntaj jñānaṁ viddhi rājasam",
    "Word_by_word": "prthaktvena—because of division; tu—but; yat jñānam—which knowledge; nānā-bhāvān—multifarious situations; prthak-vidhān—differently; vetti—one who knows; sarveṣu—in all; bhūteșu—living entities; tat jñānam—that knowledge; viddhi—must be known; rājasam—in terms of passion.",
    "Translation": "That knowledge by which a different type of living entity is seen to be dwelling in different bodies is knowledge in the mode of passion.",
    "Purport": "The concept that the material body is the living entity and that with the destruction of the body the consciousness is also destroyed is called knowledge in the mode of passion. According to that knowledge, bodies differ from one another because of the development of different types of consciousness, otherwise there is no separate soul which manifests consciousness. The body is itself the soul, and there is no separate soul beyond this body. According to such knowledge, consciousness is temporary. Or else there are no individual souls, but there is an all-pervading soul, which is full of knowledge, and this body is a manifestation of temporary ignorance. Or beyond this body there is no special individual or Supreme Soul. All such conceptions are considered products of the mode of passion."
