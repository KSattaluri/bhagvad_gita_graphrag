    "Sanskrit": "उत्सन्नकुलधर्माणां मनुष्याणां जनार्दन ।\nनरके नियतं वासो भवतीत्यनुश्रुश्रुम ॥ ४३ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "utsanna-kula-dharmāņām\nmanuṣyāṇāṁ janārdana\nnarake niyataṁ vāso\nbhavatīty anuśuśruma",
    "Word_by_word": "utsanna—spoiled; kula-dharmāṇām—of those who have the family traditions;\nmanuṣyāṇām—of such men; janārdana—O Kṛṣṇa; narake—in hell; niyatam—\nalways; vāsah—residence; bhavati—it so becomes; iti—thus; anuśuśrumа—I\nhave heard by disciplic succession.",
    "Translation": "O Kṛṣṇa, maintainer of the people, I have heard by disciplic succession that\nthose who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell.",
    "Purport": "Arjuna bases his argument not on his own personal experience, but on\nwhat he has heard from the authorities. That is the way of receiving real\nknowledge. One cannot reach the real point of factual knowledge without\nbeing helped by the right person who is already established in that knowledge.\nThere is a system in the varņāśrama institution by which one has to undergo\nthe process of ablution before death for his sinful activities. One who is always\nengaged in sinful activities must utilize the process of ablution called the\nprāyaścitta. Without doing so, one surely will be transferred to hellish planets\nto undergo miserable lives as the result of sinful activities."
