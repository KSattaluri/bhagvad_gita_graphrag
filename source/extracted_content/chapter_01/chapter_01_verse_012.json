    "Sanskrit": "तस्य सञ्ज्ञ्जनयन्हर्षं कुरुवृद्धः पितामहः ।\nसिंहनादं विनद्योच्चैः शङ्ख दध्मौ प्रतापवान् ॥ १२ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "tasya sañjanayan harṣam\nkuru-vrddhaḥ pitāmahaḥ\nsimha-nādam vinadyoccaih\nśaṅkham dadhmau pratāpavān",
    "Word_by_word": "tasya—his; sañjanayan—increasing; harṣam—cheerfulness; kuru-vṛddhaḥ—the grandsire of the Kuru dynasty (Bhīṣma); pitāmahaḥ—the grandfather; siṁha-nādam—roaring sound, like a lion; vinadya—vibrating; uccaih—very loudly; śaṅkham—conchshell; dadhmau—blew; pratāpavān—the valiant.",
    "Translation": "Then Bhīṣma, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the grandfather of the fighters, blew his conchshell very loudly like the sound of a lion, giving Duryodhana joy.",
    "Purport": "The grandsire of the Kuru dynasty could understand the inner meaning of the heart of his grandson Duryodhana, and out of his natural compassion for him he tried to cheer him by blowing his conchshell very loudly, befitting his position as a lion. Indirectly, by the symbolism of the conchshell, he informed his depressed grandson Duryodhana that he had no chance of victory in the battle, because the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa was on the other side. But still, it was his duty to conduct the fight, and no pains would be spared in that connection."
