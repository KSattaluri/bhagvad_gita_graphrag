    "Sanskrit": "ततः श्वेतैर्हयैर्युक्ते महति स्यन्दने स्थितौ ।\nमाधवः पाण्डवश्चैव दिव्यौ शङ्खौ प्रदध्मतुः ॥ १४ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "tataḥ śvetair hayair yukte\nmahati syandane sthitau\nmādhavaḥ pāndavaś caiva\ndivyau sankhau pradadhmatuh",
    "Word_by_word": "tatah—thereafter; śvetaih—by white; hayaih—horses; yukte—being yoked with; mahati—in the great; syandane—chariot; sthitau—so situated; mādhavah—Krsna (the husband of the goddess of fortune); pāndavah—Arjuna (the son of Pandu); ca—also; eva—certainly; divyau—transcendental; sankhau—conchshells; pradadhmatuh—sounded.",
    "Translation": "On the other side, both Lord Krsna and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells.",
    "Purport": "In contrast with the conchshell blown by Bhīṣmadeva, the conchshells in the hands of Krsna and Arjuna are described as transcendental. The sounding of the transcendental conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the other side because Krsna was on the side of the Pāndavas. Jayas tu pāndu-putrāṇāṁ yeṣām pakșe janārdanah. Victory is always with persons like the sons of Pandu because Lord Krsna is associated with them. And whenever and wherever the Lord is present, the goddess of fortune is also there because the goddess of fortune never lives alone without her husband. Therefore, victory and fortune were awaiting Arjuna, as indicated by the transcendental sound produced by the conchshell of Visnu, or Lord Krsna. Besides that, the chariot on which both the friends were seated was donated by Agni (the fire-god) to Arjuna, and this indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides, wherever it was drawn over the three worlds."
