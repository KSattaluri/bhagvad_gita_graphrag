    "Sanskrit": "अर्जुन उवाच\nदृष्ट्वेमं स्वजनं कृष्ण युयुत्सुं समुपस्थितम् ।\nसीदन्ति मम गात्राणि मुखं च परिशुष्यति ॥ २८ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "arjuna uvāca\ndṛṣṭvemaṁ sva-janaṁ kṛṣṇa\nyuyutsum samupasthitam\nsīdanti mama gātrāṇi\nmukham ca pariśuṣyati",
    "Word_by_word": "arjunaḥ—Arjuna; uvāca—said; dṛṣṭvā—after seeing; imam—all these; svajanam—kinsmen; kṛṣṇa—O Kṛṣṇa; yuyutsum—all in fighting spirit; samupasthitam—all present; sīdanti—quivering; mama—my; gātrāṇi—limbs of the body; mukham—mouth; ca—also; pariśuṣyati—drying up.",
    "Translation": "Arjuna said: My dear Kṛṣṇa, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth drying up.",
    "Purport": "Any man who has genuine devotion to the Lord has all the good qualities which are found in godly persons or in the demigods, whereas the nondevotee, however advanced he may be in material qualifications by education and culture, lacks in godly qualities. As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen, friends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he felt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death. And so thinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. He was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This overwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna's bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but that he was also crying out of compassion. Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is said therefore:\nyasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā\nsarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ\nharāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā\nmano-rathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ\n\"One who has unflinching devotion to the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value. This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material energy.\" (Bhāg. 5.18.12)"
