    "Sanskrit": "सर्वद्वाराणि संयम्य मनो हृदि निरुध्य च ।\nमूर्ध्याधायात्मनः प्राणमास्थितो योगधारणाम् ॥ १२ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "sarva-dvārāņi samyamya\nmano hrdi nirudhya ca\nmūrdhny ādhāyātmanaḥ prāṇam\nāsthito yoga-dhāraṇām",
    "Word_by_word": "sarva-dvārāņi—all the doors of the body; samyamya—controlling; manah—\nmind; hrdi—in the heart; nirudhya—confined; ca—also; mūrdhni—on the\nhead; ādhāya—fixed; ātmanaḥ—soul; prāṇam—the life air; āsthitaḥ—situated;\nyoga-dhāraṇām—the yogic situation.",
    "Translation": "The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing\nall the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at\nthe top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga.",
    "Purport": "To practice yoga, as suggested here, one first has to close the door of all\nsense enjoyment. This practice is called pratyāhāra, or withdrawing the senses\nfrom the sense objects. Sense organs for acquiring knowledge, such as the eyes,\nears, nose, tongue and touch, should be fully controlled and should not be\nallowed to engage in self-gratification. In this way the mind focuses on the\nSupersoul in the heart and the life force is raised to the top of the head. In the\nSixth Chapter this process is described in detail. But as mentioned before, this\npractice is not practical in this age. The best process is Krsna consciousness. If\none is always able to fix his mind on Kṛṣṇa in devotional service, it is very easy\nfor him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental trance, or in samādhi."
