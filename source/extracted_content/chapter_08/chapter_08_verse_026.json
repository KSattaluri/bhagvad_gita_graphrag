    "Sanskrit": "शुकुकृष्णे गती ह्येते जगतः शाश्वते मते ।\nएकया यात्यनावृत्तिमन्ययावर्तते पुनः ॥ २६ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "śukla-kṛṣṇe gati hy ete\njagataḥ śāśvate mate\nekayā yāty anāvṛttim\nanyayāvartate punaḥ",
    "Word_by_word": "śukla—light; kṛṣṇe—darkness; gati—passing away; hi—certainly; ete—all these; jagataḥ—of the material world; śāśvate—the Vedas; mate—in the opinion; ekayā—by one; yāti—goes; anāvṛttim—no return; anyayā—by the other; āvartate—comes back; punaḥ—again.",
    "Translation": "According to the Vedas, there are two ways of passing from this world—one in light and one in darkness. When one passes in light, he does not come back; but when one passes in darkness, he returns.",
    "Purport": "The same description of departure and return is quoted by Ācārya Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa from the Chandogya Upaniṣad. In such a way, those who are fruitive laborers and philosophical speculators from time immemorial are constantly going and coming. Actually they do not attain ultimate salvation, for they do not surrender to Kṛṣṇa."
