    "Sanskrit": "ॐ इत्येकाक्षरं ब्रह्म व्याहरन्मामनुस्मरन् ।\nयः प्रयाति त्यजन्देहं स याति परमां गतिम् ॥ १३ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "om ity ekākṣaram brahma\nvyāharan mām anusmaran\nyaḥ prayāti tyajan deham\nsa yāti paramām gatim",
    "Word_by_word": "om—the combination of letters, oṁkāra; iti—thus; eka-akṣaram—supreme, indestructible; brahma—absolute; vyāharan—vibrating; mām—Me (Kṛṣṇa); anusmaran—remembering; yaḥ—anyone; prayāti—leaves; tyajan—quitting; deham—this body; saḥ—he; yāti—achieves; paramām—supreme; gatim—destination.",
    "Translation": "After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable om, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.",
    "Purport": "It is clearly stated here that om, Brahman, and Lord Kṛṣṇa are not different. The impersonal sound of Kṛṣṇa is om, but the sound Hare Kṛṣṇa contains om. It is clearly recommended in this age that if one quits his body at the end of this life chanting the mahāmantra, Hare Kṛṣṇa, he will reach the spiritual planets. Similarly, those who are devotees of Kṛṣṇa enter the Kṛṣṇa planet or Goloka Vṛndāvana, whereas the impersonalists remain in the brahmajyoti. The personalists also enter many innumerable planets in the spiritual sky known as Vaikuṇṭhas."
