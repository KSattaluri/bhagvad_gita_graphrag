    "Word_by_word": "punyah—original; gandhah—fragrance; prthivyām—in the earth; ca—also; tejah—temperature; ca—also; asmi—I am; vibhāvasau—in the fire; jīvanam—life; sarva—all; bhūteșu—living entities; tapah—penance; ca—also; asmi—I am; tapasvișu—in those who practice penance.",
    "Translation": "I am the original fragrance of the earth, and I am the heat in fire. I am the life of all that lives, and I am the penances of all ascetics.",
    "Purport": "Punya means that which is not decomposed; punya is original. Everything in the material world has a certain flavor or fragrance, as the flavor and fragrance in a flower, or in the earth, in water, in fire, in air, etc. The uncontaminated flavor, the original flavor, which permeates everything, is Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, everything has a particular original taste, and this taste can be changed by the mixture of chemicals. So everything original has some smell, some fragrance, and some taste. Vibhāva means fire. Without fire we cannot run factories, we cannot cook, etc., and that fire is Krsna. The heat in the fire is Krsna. According to Vedic medicine, indigestion is due to a low temperature in the belly. So even for digestion fire is needed. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness we become aware that earth, water, fire, air and every active principle, all chemicals and all material elements are due to Krsna. The duration of man's life is also due to Krsna. Therefore by the grace of Krsna, man can prolong his life or diminish it. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness is active in every sphere."
