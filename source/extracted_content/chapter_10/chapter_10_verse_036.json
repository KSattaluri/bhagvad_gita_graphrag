    "Word_by_word": "dyūtam—gambling; chalayatām—of all cheats; asmi—I am; tejah—splendid; tejasvinām—of everything splendid; aham—I am; jayah—victory; asmi—I am; vyavasāyah—adventure; asmi—I am; sattvam—strength; sattvavatām—of all the strong; aham—I am.",
    "Translation": "I am also the gambling of cheats, and of the splendid I am the splendor. I am victory, I am adventure, and I am the strength of the strong.",
    "Purport": "There are many kinds of cheaters all over the universe. Of all cheating processes, gambling stands supreme and therefore represents Krsna. As the Supreme, Krsna can be more deceitful than any mere man. If Kṛṣṇa chooses to deceive a person, no one can surpass Him in His deceit. His greatness is not simply one-sided—it is all-sided.\nAmong the victorious, He is victory. He is the splendor of the splendid. Among enterprising industrialists, He is the most enterprising. Among adventurers, He is the most adventurous, and among the strong, He is the strongest. When Krsna was present on earth, no one could surpass Him in strength. Even in His childhood He lifted Govardhana Hill. No one can surpass Him in cheating, no one can surpass Him in splendor, no one can surpass Him in victory, no one can surpass Him in enterprise, and no one can surpass Him in strength."
