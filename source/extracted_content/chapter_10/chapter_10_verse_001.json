    "Sanskrit": "श्रीभगवानुवाच\nभूय एव महाबाहो शृणु मे परमं वचः ।\nयत्तेऽहं प्रीयमाणाय वक्ष्यामि हितकाम्यया ॥ १ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nbhūya eva mahā-bāho\nśṛṇu me paramam vacah\nyat te 'haṁ priyamāṇāya\nvakṣyāmi hita-kāmyayā",
    "Word_by_word": "śrī bhagavān uvāca—the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; bhūyah—\nagain; eva—certainly; mahā-bāho—O mighty-armed; śrņu—just hear; me—\nMy; paramam—supreme; vacah—information; yat—that which; te—to you;\naham—I; prīyamāṇāya—thinking you dear to Me; vakṣyāmi—say; hita-\nkāmyayā—for your benefit.",
    "Translation": "The Supreme Lord said: My dear friend, mighty-armed Arjuna, listen again to\nMy supreme word, which I shall impart to you for your benefit and which will\ngive you great joy.",
    "Purport": "The word paramam is explained thus by Parāśara Muni: one who is full in\nsix opulences, who has full strength, full fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and\nrenunciation, is paramam, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. While\nKṛṣṇa was present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences. Therefore\ngreat sages like Parāśara Muni have all accepted Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Now Krsna is instructing Arjuna in more confidential\nknowledge of His opulences and His work. Previously, beginning with the\nSeventh Chapter, the Lord already explained His different energies and how\nthey are acting. Now in this chapter He explains His specific opulences to\nArjuna. In the previous chapter he has clearly explained His different energies\nto establish devotion in firm conviction. Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna\nabout His manifestations and various opulences.\nThe more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed in\ndevotional service. One should always hear about the Lord in the association\nof devotees; that will enhance one's devotional service. Discourses in the\nsociety of devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to\nbe in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Others cannot take part in such discourses. The\nLord clearly tells Arjuna that because he is very dear to Him, for his benefit\nsuch discourses are taking place."
