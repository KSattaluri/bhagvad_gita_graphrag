    "Purport": "Among the many celestial Naga serpents, Ananta is the greatest, as is Varuņa among the aquatics. They both represent Krsna. There is also a planet of trees presided over by Aryamā, who represents Krsna. There are many living entities who give punishment to the miscreants, and among them Yama is the chief. Yama is situated in a planet near this earthly planet, and after death those who are very sinful are taken there, and Yama arranges different kinds of punishments for them."
