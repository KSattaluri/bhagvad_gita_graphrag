    "Sanskrit": "द्यावापृथिव्योरिदमन्तरं हि\nव्याप्तं त्वयैकेन दिशश्च सर्वाः ।\nदृष्ट्वाद्भुतं रूपमुग्रं तवेदं\nलोकत्रयं प्रव्यथितं महात्मन् ॥ २० ॥",
    "Transliteration": "dyāv ā-pṛthivyor idam antaram hi\nvyāptaṁ tvayaikena diśaś ca sarvāḥ\ndṛṣṭvādbhutam rūpam ugram tavedam\nloka-trayam pravyathitam mahātman",
    "Word_by_word": "dyau—in outer space; āpṛthivyoh—of the earth; idam—this; antaram—in between; hi—certainly; vyāptam—pervaded; tvayā—by You; ekena—by one; diśaḥ—directions; ca—and; sarvāḥ—all; dṛṣṭvā—by seeing; adbhutam—wonderful; rūpam—form; ugram—terrible; tava—Your; idam—this; loka—planetary system; trayam—three; pravyathitam—perturbed; mahātman—O great one.",
    "Translation": "Although You are one, You are spread throughout the sky and the planets and all space between. O great one, as I behold this terrible form, I see that all the planetary systems are perplexed.",
    "Purport": "Dyāv āpṛthivyoh (the space between heaven and earth) and lokatrayam (three worlds) are significant words in this verse because it appears that not only Arjuna saw this universal form of the Lord, but others in other planetary systems also saw it. The vision was not a dream. All who were spiritually awake with the divine vision saw it."
