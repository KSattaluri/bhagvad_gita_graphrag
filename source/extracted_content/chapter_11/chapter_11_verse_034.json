    "Sanskrit": "द्रोणं च भीष्मं च जयद्रथं च कर्णं तथान्यानपि योधवीरान् ।\nमया हतांस्त्वं जहि माव्यथिष्ठा युध्यस्व जेतासि रणे सपत्नान् ॥ ३४ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "droņam ca bhīṣmaṁ ca jayadratham ca\nkarņam tathānyān api yodha-vīrān\nmayā hatāṁs tvaṁ jahi mā vyathisthā\nyudhyasva jetāsi raṇe sapatnān",
    "Word_by_word": "droņam ca—also Droņa; bhīṣmam ca—also Bhīṣma; jayadratham ca—also Jayadratha; karņam—also Karņa; tathā—also; anyān—others; api—certainly; yodha-vīrān—great warriors; mayā—by Me; hatān—already killed; tvam—you; jahi—become victorious; mā—never; vyathisthāḥ—be disturbed; yudhyasva—just fight; jetāsi—just conquer; raṇe—in the fight; sapatnān—enemies.",
    "Translation": "The Blessed Lord said: All the great warriors—Droņa, Bhīṣma, Jayadratha, Karņa—are already destroyed. Simply fight, and you will vanquish your enemies.",
    "Purport": "Every plan is made by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He is so kind and merciful to His devotees that He wants to give the credit to His devotees who carry out His plan according to His desire. Life should therefore move in such a way that everyone acts in Krsna consciousness and understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the medium of a spiritual master. The plans of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are understood by His mercy, and the plans of the devotees are as good as His plans. One should follow such plans and be victorious in the struggle for existence."
