    "Sanskrit": "अनादिमध्यान्तमनन्तवीर्य-\nमनन्तबाहुं शशिसूर्यनेत्रम् ।\nपश्यामि त्वां दीप्तहुताशवत्रं\nस्वतेजसा विश्वमिदं तपन्तम् ॥ १९ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "anādi-madhyāntam ananta-vīryam\nananta-bāhuṁ śaśi-sūrya-netram\npaśyāmi tvām dīpta-hutāśa-vaktram\nsva-tejasā viśvam idam tapantam",
    "Word_by_word": "anādi—without beginning; madhya—without middle; antam—without end; ananta—unlimited; vīryam—glorious; ananta—unlimited; bāhum—arms; śaśi—moon; sūrya—sun; netram—eyes; paśyāmi—I see; tvām—You; dīpta—blazing; hutāśa-vaktram—fire coming out of Your mouth; sva-tejasā—by Your; viśvam—this universe; idam—this; tapantam—heating.",
    "Translation": "You are the origin without beginning, middle or end. You have numberless arms, and the sun and moon are among Your great unlimited eyes. By Your own radiance You are heating this entire universe.",
    "Purport": "There is no limit to the extent of the six opulences of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here and in many other places there is repetition, but according to the scriptures, repetition of the glories of Krsņa is not a literary weakness. It is said that at a time of bewilderment or wonder or of great ecstasy, statements are repeated over and over. That is not a flaw."
