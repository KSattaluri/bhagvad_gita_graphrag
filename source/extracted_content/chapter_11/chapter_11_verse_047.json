    "Sanskrit": "श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\nमया प्रसन्नेन तवार्जुनेदं रूपं परं दर्शितमात्मयोगात् ।\nतेजोमयं विश्वमनन्तमाद्यं यन्मे त्वदन्येन न दृष्टपूर्वम् ॥ ४७ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nmayā prasannena tavārjunedam\nrūpam param darśitam ātma-yogāt\ntejo-mayaṁ viśvam anantam ādyam\nyan me tvad anyena na drșta-pūrvam",
    "Word_by_word": "śrī bhagavān uvāca—the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; mayā—by Me; prasannena—happily; tava—unto you; arjuna—O Arjuna; idam—this; rūpaṁ —form; param—transcendental; darśitam—shown; ātma-yogāt—by My internal potency; tejomayam—full of effulgence; viśvam—the entire universe; anantam—unlimited; ādyam—original; yat me—that which is Mine; tvat-anyena—besides you; na drșta-pūrvam—no one has previously seen.",
    "Translation": "The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, happily do I show you this universal form within the material world by My internal potency. No one before you has ever seen this unlimited and glaringly effulgent form.",
    "Purport": "Arjuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so out of His mercy upon His devotee Arjuna, Lord Kṛṣṇa showed His universal form full of effulgence and opulence. This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces were rapidly changing. Kṛṣṇa showed this form just to satisfy the desire of His friend Arjuna. This form was manifested by Kṛṣṇa through His internal potency, which is inconceivable by human speculation. No one had seen this universal form of the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was shown to Arjuna, other devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also see it. They did not see it before, but because of Arjuna they were also able to see it. In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the universal form which was shown to Arjuna by the mercy of Krsna. Someone commented that this form was shown to Duryodhana also when Krsna went to Duryodhana to negotiate for peace. Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the peace offer, but at that time Krșņa manifested some of His universal forms. But those forms are different from this one shown to Arjuna. It is clearly said that no one has ever seen this form before."
