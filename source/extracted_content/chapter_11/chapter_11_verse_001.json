    "Sanskrit": "अर्जुन उवाच\nमदनुग्रहाय परमं गुह्यमध्यात्मसंज्ञितम्\nयत्त्वयोक्तं वचस्तेन मोहोऽयं विगतो मम ॥ १ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "arjuna uvāca\nmad-anugrahāya paramam\nguhyam adhyātma-samjñitam\nyat tvayoktam vacas tena\nmoho 'yam vigato mama",
    "Word_by_word": "arjunah uvāca—Arjuna said; mat-anugrahāya—just to show me favor; paramam—supreme; guhyam—confidential; adhyātma—spiritual; samjñitam —in the matter of; yat—what; tvayā—by You; uktam—said; vacah—words; tena—by that; mohah—illusion; ayam—this; vigatah—is educated; mama—my.",
    "Translation": "Arjuna said: I have heard Your instruction on confidential spiritual matters which You have so kindly delivered unto me, and my illusion is now dispelled.",
    "Purport": "This chapter reveals Kṛṣṇa as the cause of all causes. He is even the cause of the Mahā-Vişnu, and from Him the material universes emanate. Kṛṣṇa is not an incarnation; He is the source of all incarnations. That has been completely explained in the last chapter.\nNow, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This means that Arjuna no longer thinks of Kṛṣṇa as a mere human being, as a friend of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has a great friend like Kṛṣṇa, but now he is thinking that although he may accept Krsna as the source of everything, others may not. So in order to establish Kṛṣṇa's divinity for all, he is requesting Krsna in this chapter to show His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of Krsna one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but Kṛṣṇa is so kind that after showing it He converts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what Krsna says several times. Kṛṣṇa is speaking to him just for his benefit, and Arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by Kṛṣṇa's grace. He is now convinced that Kṛṣṇa is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone's heart as the Supersoul."
