    "Sanskrit": "एवमुक्तवा हृषीकेशं गुडाकेशः परन्तपः ।\nन योत्स्य इति गोविन्दमुक्त्वा तूर्णी बभूव ह ॥ ९ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "evam uktvā hṛṣīkeśam\ngudākeśaḥ parantapaḥ\nna yotsya iti govindam\nuktvā tūṣṇīṁ babhūva ha",
    "Word_by_word": "sañjayaḥ uvāca—Sañjaya said; evam—thus; uktvā—speaking; hṛṣīkeśam—unto Kṛṣṇa, the master of the senses; guḍākeśaḥ—Arjuna, the master at curbing ignorance; parantapaḥ—the chastiser of the enemies; na yotsye—I shall not fight; iti—thus; govindam—unto Kṛṣṇa, the giver of pleasure; uktvā—saying; tūṣṇīm—silent; babhūva—became; ha—certainly.",
    "Translation": "Sañjaya said: Having spoken thus, Arjuna, chastiser of enemies, told Kṛṣṇa, “Govinda, I shall not fight,” and fell silent.",
    "Purport": "Dhṛtarāstra must have been very glad to understand that Arjuna was not going to fight and was instead leaving the battlefield for the begging profession. But Sañjaya disappointed him again in relating that Arjuna was competent to kill his enemies (parantapaḥ). Although Arjuna was for the time being overwhelmed with false grief due to family affection, he surrendered unto Kṛṣṇa, the supreme spiritual master, as a disciple. This indicated that he would soon be free from the false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened with perfect knowledge of self-realization, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and would then surely fight. Thus Dhṛtarāstra's joy would be frustrated, since Arjuna would be enlightened by Kṛṣṇa and would fight to the end."
