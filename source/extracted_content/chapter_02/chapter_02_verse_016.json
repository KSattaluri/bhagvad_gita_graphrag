    "Sanskrit": "नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः ।\nउभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभिः ॥ १६ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "nāsato vidyate bhāvo\nnābhāvo vidyate satah\nubhayor api drșto 'ntas\ntv anayos tattva-darśibhiḥ",
    "Word_by_word": "na—never; asatah—of the nonexistent; vidyate—there is; bhāvaḥ—\nendurance; na—never; abhāvaḥ—changing quality; vidyate—there is; satah—\nof the eternal; ubhayoh—of the two; api—verily; dṛṣṭaḥ—observed; antah—\nconclusion; tu—but; anayoh—of them; tattva—truth; darśibhiḥ—by the seers.",
    "Translation": "Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the nonexistent there\nis no endurance, and of the existent there is no cessation. This seers have\nconcluded by studying the nature of both.",
    "Purport": "There is no endurance of the changing body. That the body is changing\nevery moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by\nmodern medical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the\nbody. But the spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all\nchanges of the body and the mind. That is the difference between matter and\nspirit. By nature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal. This\nconclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist\nand personalist. In the Vișnu Purāṇa it is stated that Visņu and His abodes all\nhave self-illuminated spiritual existence. “Jyotīmși vişnur bhavanāni vişnuh.”\nThe words existent and nonexistent refer only to spirit and matter. That is the\nversion of all seers of truth.\nThis is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities who\nare bewildered by the influence of ignorance. Removal of ignorance involves\nthe reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper and the\nworshipable and the consequent understanding of the difference between the\npart and parcel living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One\ncan understand the nature of the Supreme by thorough study of oneself, the\ndifference between oneself and the Supreme being understood as the\nrelationship between the part and the whole. In the Vedānta-sūtras, as well as\nin the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, the Supreme has been accepted as the origin of all\nemanations. Such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural\nsequences. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as it will be\nrevealed in the Seventh Chapter. Although there is no difference between the\nenergy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and energy\nor nature is accepted as the subordinate. The living entities, therefore, are\nalways subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case of the master and the\nservant, or the teacher and the taught. Such clear knowledge is impossible to\nunderstand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such ignorance the\nLord teaches the Bhagavad-gītā for the enlightenment of all living entities for\nall time."
