    "Sanskrit": "तस्माद्यस्य महाबाहो निगृहीतानि सर्वशः ।\nइन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥ ६८ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "tasmād yasya mahā-bāho\nnigṛhītāni sarvaśaḥ\nindriyāṇīndriyārthebhyas\ntasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā",
    "Word_by_word": "tasmāt—therefore; yasya—of one's; mahā-bāho—O mighty-armed one; nigṛhītāni—so curbed down; sarvaśaḥ—all around; indriyāṇi—the senses; indriya-arthebhyaḥ—for the sake of sense objects; tasya—his; prajñā— intelligence; pratiṣṭhitā—fixed.",
    "Translation": "Therefore, O mighty-armed, one whose senses are restrained from their objects is certainly of steady intelligence.",
    "Purport": "As enemies are curbed by superior force, similarly, the senses can be curbed not by any human endeavor, but only by keeping them engaged in the service of the Lord. One who has understood this—that only by Kṛṣṇa consciousness is one really established in intelligence and that one should practice this art under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master—is called sādhaka, or a suitable candidate for liberation."
