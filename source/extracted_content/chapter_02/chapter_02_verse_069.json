    "Purport": "There are two classes of intelligent men. The one is intelligent in material\nactivities for sense gratification, and the other is introspective and awake to\nthe cultivation of self-realization. Activities of the introspective sage, or\nthoughtful man, are night for persons materially absorbed. Materialistic\npersons remain asleep in such a night due to their ignorance of self-realization.\nThe introspective sage remains alert in the \"night” of the materialistic men.\nThe sage feels transcendental pleasure in the gradual advancement of spiritual\nculture, whereas the man in materialistic activities, being asleep to self-\nrealization, dreams of varieties of sense pleasure, feeling sometimes happy and\nsometimes distressed in his sleeping condition. The introspective man is\nalways indifferent to materialistic happiness and distress. He goes on with his\nself-realization activities undisturbed by material reaction."
