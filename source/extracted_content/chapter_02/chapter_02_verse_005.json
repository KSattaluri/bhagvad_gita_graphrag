    "Sanskrit": "गुरूनहत्वा हि महानुभावान्\nश्रेयो भोक्तुं भैक्ष्यमपीह लोके ।\nहत्वार्थकामांस्तु गुरुनिहैव\nभुञ्जीय भोगान्रुधिरप्रदिग्धान् ॥ ५ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "gurūn ahatvā hi mahānubhāvān\nśreyo bhoktum bhaikṣyam apīha loke\nhatvārtha-kāmāms tu gurūn ihaiva\nbhuñjīya bhogān rudhira-pradigdhān",
    "Word_by_word": "gurūn—the superiors; ahatvā—by killing; hi—certainly; mahā-anubhāvān—\ngreat souls; śreyah—it is better; bhoktum—to enjoy life; bhaikṣyam—begging;\napi—even; iha—in this life; loke—in this world; hatvā—killing; artha—gain;\nkāmān—so desiring; tu—but; gurūn—superiors; iha—in this world; eva—\ncertainly; bhuñjīya—has to enjoy; bhogān—enjoyable things; rudhira—blood;\npradigdhān—tainted with.",
    "Translation": "It is better to live in this world by begging than to live at the cost of the lives of\ngreat souls who are my teachers. Even though they are avaricious, they are\nnonetheless superiors. If they are killed, our spoils will be tainted with blood.",
    "Purport": "According to scriptural codes, a teacher who engages in an abominable\naction and has lost his sense of discrimination is fit to be abandoned. Bhīṣma\nand Drona were obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because of his\nfinancial assistance, although they should not have accepted such a position\nsimply on financial considerations. Under the circumstances, they have lost\nthe respectability of teachers. But Arjuna thinks that nevertheless they\nremain his superiors, and therefore to enjoy material profits after killing them\nwould mean to enjoy spoils tainted with blood."
