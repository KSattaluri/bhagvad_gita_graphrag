    "Sanskrit": "न चैतद्विद्मः कतरन्नो गरीयो\nयद्वा जयेम यदि वा नो जयेयुः ।\nयानेव हत्वा न जिजीविषाम-\nस्तेऽवस्थिताः प्रमुखे धार्तराष्ट्राः ॥ ६ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "na caitad vidmah kataran no garīyo\nyad vā jayema yadi vā no jayeyuh\nyān eva hatvā na jijīviṣāmas\nte 'vasthitāḥ pramukhe dhārtarāstrāh",
    "Word_by_word": "na—nor; ca—also; etat—this; vidmah—do know; katarat—which; nah—us;\ngarīyah—better; yat—what; vā—either; jayema—conquer us; yadi—if; vā—\nor; nah—us; jayeyuḥ—conquer; yān—those; eva—certainly; hatvā—by killing;\nna—never; jijīviṣāmaḥ—want to live; te—all of them; avasthitāḥ—are\nsituated; pramukhe—in the front; dhārtarāstrāḥ—the sons of Dhṛtarāstra.",
    "Translation": "Nor do we know which is better—conquering them or being conquered by\nthem. The sons of Dhṛtarāstra, whom if we killed we should not care to live,\nare now standing before us on this battlefield.",
    "Purport": "Arjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary\nviolence, although fighting is the duty of the kṣatriyas, or whether he should\nrefrain and live by begging. If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be\nhis only means of subsistence. Nor was there certainty of victory, because\neither side might emerge victorious. Even if victory awaited them (and their\ncause was justified), still, if the sons of Dhṛtarāstra died in battle, it would be\nvery difficult to live in their absence. Under the circumstances, that would be\nanother kind of defeat for them. All these considerations by Arjuna definitely\nprove that he was not only a great devotee of the Lord but that he was also\nhighly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses. His\ndesire to live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is\nanother sign of detachment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities,\ncombined with his faith in the words of instruction of Śrī Kṛṣṇa (his spiritual\nmaster), indicate. It is concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation.\nUnless the senses are controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the\nplatform of knowledge, and without knowledge and devotion there is no\nchance of liberation. Arjuna was competent in all these attributes, over and\nabove his enormous attributes in his material relationships."
