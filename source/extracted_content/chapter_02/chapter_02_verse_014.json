    "Sanskrit": "मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदुःखदाः ।\nआगमापायिनोऽनित्यास्तांस्तितिक्षस्व भारत ॥ १४ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya\nśītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ\nāgamāpāyino 'nityās\ntāṁs titikṣasva bhārata",
    "Word_by_word": "mātrā—sensuous; sparśāḥ—perception; tu—only; kaunteya—O son of Kuntī;\nśīta—winter; uṣṇa—summer; sukha—happiness; duḥkha-dāḥ—giving pain;\nāgama—appearing; apāyinaḥ—disappearing; anityāḥ—nonpermanent; tān—\nall of them; titikṣasva—just try to tolerate; bhārata—O descendant of the\nBhārata dynasty.",
    "Translation": "O son of Kuntī, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and\ntheir disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of\nwinter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of\nBharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.",
    "Purport": "In the proper discharge of duty, one has to learn to tolerate nonpermanent\nappearances and disappearances of happiness and distress. According to Vedic\ninjunction, one has to take his bath early in the morning even during the\nmonth of Māgha (January-February). It is very cold at that time, but in spite of\nthat a man who abides by the religious principles does not hesitate to take his\nbath. Similarly, a woman does not hesitate to cook in the kitchen in the\nmonths of May and June, the hottest part of the summer season. One has to\nexecute his duty in spite of climatic inconveniences. Similarly, to fight is the\nreligious principle of the kṣatriyas, and although one has to fight with some\nfriend or relative, one should not deviate from his prescribed duty. One has to\nfollow the prescribed rules and regulations of religious principles in order to\nrise up to the platform of knowledge because by knowledge and devotion only\ncan one liberate himself from the clutches of māyā (illusion).\nThe two different names of address given to Arjuna are also significant. To\naddress him as Kaunteya signifies his great blood relations from his mother's\nside; and to address him as Bhārata signifies his greatness from his father's side.\nFrom both sides he is supposed to have a great heritage. A great heritage brings\nresponsibility in the matter of proper discharge of duties; therefore, he cannot\navoid fighting."
