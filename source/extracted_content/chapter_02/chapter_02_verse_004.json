    "Sanskrit": "कथं भीष्ममहं संख्ये द्रोणं च मधुसूदन ।\nइषुभिः प्रतियोत्स्यामि पूजार्हावरिसूदन ॥ ४ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "kathaṁ bhīṣmam ahaṁ saṅkhye\ndroṇaṁ ca madhusūdana\niṣubhiḥ pratiyotsyāmi\npūjārhāv arisūdana ॥ 4 ॥",
    "Word_by_word": "arjunah uvāca—Arjuna said; katham—how; bhīṣmam—unto Bhīṣma; aham—I; saṅkhye—in the fight; droṇam—unto Droṇa; ca—also, madhusūdana—O killer of Madhu; iṣubhih—with arrows; pratiyotsyāmi—shall counterattack; pūjā-arhau—those who are worshipable; arisūdana—O killer of the enemies.",
    "Translation": "Arjuna said: O killer of Madhu [Kṛṣṇa], how can I counterattack with arrows in battle men like Bhīṣma and Droṇa, who are worthy of my worship?",
    "Purport": "Respectable superiors like Bhīṣma the grandfather and Droṇācārya the teacher are always worshipable. Even if they attack, they should not be counterattacked. It is general etiquette that superiors are not to be offered even a verbal fight. Even if they are sometimes harsh in behavior, they should not be harshly treated. Then, how is it possible for Arjuna to counterattack them? Would Kṛṣṇa ever attack His own grandfather, Ugrasena, or His teacher, Sāndīpani Muni? These were some of the arguments by Arjuna to Kṛṣṇa."
