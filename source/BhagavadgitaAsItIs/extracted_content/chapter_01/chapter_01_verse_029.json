    "Sanskrit": "वेपथुश्च शरीरे मे रोमहर्षश्च जायते ।\nगाण्डीवं खंसते हस्तात्त्वक्चैव परिदह्यते ॥ २९ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "vepathuś ca śarīre me\nroma-harṣaś ca jāyate\ngāṇḍīvaṁ sraṁsate hastāt\ntvak caiva paridahyate",
    "Word_by_word": "vepathuḥ—trembling of the body; ca—also; śarīre—on the body; me—my; roma-harṣaḥ—standing of hair on end; ca—also; jāyate—is taking place; gāṇḍīvam—the bow of Arjuna; sraṁsate—is slipping; hastāt—from the hands; tvak—skin; ca—also; eva—certainly; paridahyate—burning.",
    "Translation": "My whole body is trembling, and my hair is standing on end. My bow Gāṇḍīva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning.",
    "Purport": "There are two kinds of trembling of the body, and two kinds of standings of the hair on end. Such phenomena occur either in great spiritual ecstasy or out of great fear under material conditions. There is no fear in transcendental realization. Arjuna’s symptoms in this situation are out of material fear—namely, loss of life. This is evident from other symptoms also; he became so impatient that his famous bow Gāṇḍīva was slipping from his hands, and, because his heart was burning within him, he was feeling a burning sensation of the skin. All these are due to a material conception of life."
