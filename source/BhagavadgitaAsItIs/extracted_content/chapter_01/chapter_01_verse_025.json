    "Sanskrit": "भीष्मद्रोणप्रमुखतः सर्वेषां च महीक्षिताम् ।\nउवाच पार्थ पश्यैतान्समवेतान्कुरूनिति ॥ २५ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "bhīṣma-droṇa-pramukhataḥ\nsarveṣāṁ ca mahī-kṣitām\nuvāca pārtha paśyaitān\nsamavetān kurūn iti",
    "Word_by_word": "bhīṣma—Grandfather Bhīṣma; droṇa—the teacher Droņa; pramukhataḥ—in the front of; sarveṣām—all; ca—also; mahīkṣitām—chiefs of the world; uvāca—said; pārtha—O Pārtha (son of Pṛthā); paśya—just behold; etān—all of them; samavetān—assembled; kurūn—all the members of the Kuru dynasty; iti—thus.",
    "Translation": "In the presence of Bhīṣma, Droṇa and all other chieftains of the world, Hṛṣīkeśa, the Lord, said, “Just behold, Pārtha, all the Kurus who are assembled here.”",
    "Purport": "As the Supersoul of all living entities, Lord Kṛṣṇa could understand what was going on in the mind of Arjuna. The use of the word Hṛṣīkeśa in this connection indicates that He knew everything. And the word Pārtha, or the son of Kuntī or Pṛthā, is also similarly significant in reference to Arjuna. As a friend, He wanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son of Pṛthā, the sister of His own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the charioteer of Arjuna. Now what did Kṛṣṇa mean when He told Arjuna to “behold the Kurus”? Did Arjuna want to stop there and not fight? Kṛṣṇa never expected such things from the son of His aunt Pṛthā. The mind of Arjuna was thus predicated by the Lord in friendly joking."
