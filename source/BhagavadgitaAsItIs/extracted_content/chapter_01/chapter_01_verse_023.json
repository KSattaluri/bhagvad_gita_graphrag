    "Purport": "It was an open secret that Duryodhana wanted to usurp the kingdom of the\nPāndavas by evil plans, in collaboration with his father, Dhṛtarāstra.\nTherefore, all persons who had joined the side of Duryodhana must have been\nbirds of the same feather. Arjuna wanted to see them in the battlefield before\nthe fight was begun, just to learn who they were, but he had no intention of\nproposing peace negotiations with them. It was also a fact that he wanted to\nsee them to make an estimate of the strength which he had to face, although\nhe was quite confident of victory because Kṛṣṇa was sitting by his side."
