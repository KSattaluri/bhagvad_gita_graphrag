    "Sanskrit": "सञ्जय उवाच\nएवमुक्वार्जुनः संख्ये रथोपस्थ उपाविशत् ।\nविसृज्य सशरं चापं शोकसंविग्नमानसः ॥ ४६ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "sañjaya uvāca\nevam uktvārjunaḥ sankhye\nrathopastha upāviśat\nvisṛjya sa-śaram cāpam\nśoka-saṁvigna-mānasah",
    "Word_by_word": "sañjayah—Sañjaya; uvāca—said; evam—thus; uktvā—saying; arjunah—Arjuna; sankhye—in the battlefield; ratha—chariot; upasthah—situated on; upāviśat—sat down again; visṛjya—keeping aside; sa-śaram—along with arrows; cāpam—the bow; śoka—lamentation; saṁvigna—distressed; mānasah—within the mind.",
    "Translation": "Sañjaya said: Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief.",
    "Purport": "While observing the situation of his enemy, Arjuna stood up on the chariot, but he was so afflicted with lamentation that he sat down again, setting aside his bow and arrows. Such a kind and softhearted person, in the devotional service of the Lord, is fit to receive self-knowledge.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the First Chapter of the Śrīmad-Bhagavad-gītā in the matter of Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra."
