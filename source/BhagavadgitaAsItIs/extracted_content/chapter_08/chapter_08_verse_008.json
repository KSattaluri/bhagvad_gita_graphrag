    "Verse": 8,
    "Sanskrit": "अभ्यासयोगयुक्तेन चेतसा नान्यगामिना ।\nपरमं पुरुषं दिव्यं याति पार्थानुचिन्तयन् ॥ ८ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "abhyāsa-yoga-yuktena\ncetasā nānya-gāminā\nparamam puruṣaṁ divyam\nyāti pārthānucintayan",
    "Word_by_word": "abhyāsa—practice; yoga-yuktena—being engaged in meditation; cetasā—by the mind and intelligence; na anya-gāminā—without being deviated; paramam—the Supreme; puruṣam—Personality of Godhead; divyam—transcendental; yāti—achieves; pārtha—O son of Pṛthā; anucintayan—constantly thinking of.",
    "Translation": "He who meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O Pārtha [Arjuna], is sure to reach Me.",
    "Purport": "In this verse Lord Kṛṣṇa stresses the importance of remembering Him.\nOne's memory of Kṛṣṇa is revived by chanting the mahāmantra, Hare Kṛṣṇa.\nBy this practice of chanting and hearing the sound vibration of the Supreme\nLord, one's ear, tongue and mind are engaged. This mystic meditation is very\neasy to practice, and it helps one attain the Supreme Lord. Puruṣam means\nenjoyer. Although living entities belong to the marginal energy of the\nSupreme Lord, they are in material contamination. They think themselves\nenjoyers, but they are not the supreme enjoyer. Here it is clearly stated that\nthe supreme enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different\nmanifestations and plenary expansions as Nārāyaṇa, Vāsudeva, etc.\nThe devotees can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme Lord,\nin any of His features, Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Rāma, etc., by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.\nThis practice will purify him, and at the end of his life, due to his constant\nchanting, he will be transferred to the kingdom of God. Yoga practice is\nmeditation on the Supersoul within; similarly, by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa one\nfixes his mind always on the Supreme Lord. The mind is fickle, and therefore\nit is necessary to engage the mind by force to think of Kṛṣṇa. One example\noften given is that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so\nis transformed into a butterfly in the same life. Similarly, if we constantly\nthink of Kṛṣṇa, it is certain that at the end of our lives we shall have the same\nbodily constitution as Kṛṣṇa."
