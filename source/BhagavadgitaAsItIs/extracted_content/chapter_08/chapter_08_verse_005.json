    "Sanskrit": "अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम् । यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः ॥ ५ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "anta-kāle ca mām eva smaran muktvā kalevaram yaḥ prayāti sa mad-bhāvam yāti nāsty atra saṁśayaḥ",
    "Word_by_word": "anta-kāle—at the end of life; ca—also; mām—unto Me; eva—certainly; smaran—remembering; muktvā—quitting; kalevaram—the body; yaḥ—he who; prayāti—goes; saḥ—he; mad-bhāvam—My nature; yāti—achieves; na—not; asti—there is; atra—here; saṁśayaḥ—doubt.",
    "Translation": "And whoever, at the time of death, quits his body, remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.",
    "Purport": "In this verse the importance of Krsna consciousness is stressed. Anyone who quits his body in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is at once transferred to the transcendental abode of the Supreme Lord. The word smaran (remembering) is important. Remembrance of Krsna is not possible for the impure soul who has not practiced Krsna consciousness in devotional service. To remember Krsna one should chant the mahāmantra, Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, incessantly, following in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya, being more tolerant than the tree, humbler than the grass and offering all respect to others without requiring respect in return. In such a way one will be able to depart from the body successfully remembering Kṛṣṇa and so attain the supreme goal."
