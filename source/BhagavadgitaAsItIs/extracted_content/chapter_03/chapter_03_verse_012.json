    "Sanskrit": "इष्टान्भोगान्हि वो देवा दास्यन्ते यज्ञभाविताः ।\nतैर्दत्तानप्रदायैभ्यो यो भुङ्के स्तेन एव सः ॥ १२ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "iṣṭān bhogān hi vo devā\ndāsyante yajña-bhāvitāḥ\ntair dattān apradāyaibhyo\nyo bhuṅkte stena eva saḥ",
    "Word_by_word": "iṣṭān—desired; bhogān—necessities of life; hi—certainly; vaḥ—unto you;\ndevāḥ—the demigods; dāsyante—award; yajña-bhāvitāḥ—being satisfied by the\nperformance of sacrifices; taiḥ—by them; dattān—things given; apradāya—\nwithout offering; ebhyaḥ—to the demigods; yaḥ—he who; bhuṅkte—enjoys;\nstenaḥ—thief; eva—certainly; saḥ—is he.",
    "Translation": "In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by the\nperformance of yajña [sacrifice], supply all necessities to man. But he who\nenjoys these gifts, without offering them to the demigods in return, is certainly\na thief.",
    "Purport": "The demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, Viṣṇu. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the\nperformance of prescribed yajñas. In the Vedas, there are different kinds of\nyajñas prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered\nto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand what\nthe Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended.\nAccording to the different material qualities of the persons concerned,\ndifferent types of yajñas are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different\ndemigods is also on the same basis—namely, according to different qualities.\nFor example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess Kālī,\nthe ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of\nanimals is recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the\ntranscendental worship of Viṣṇu is recommended. But ultimately, all yajñas\nare meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary\nmen, at least five yajñas, known as pañca-mahāyajña, are necessary.\nOne should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human\nsociety requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can\nmanufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society.\nThese eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the\npersons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like\nmeats, etc., none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for\nexample heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life—none of\nthem can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord,\nthere can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without\nwhich no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependant on supplies from the\nLord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw\nmaterials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials—all\nof which are supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we\nshould make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the\npurpose of self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely,\nliberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained\nby performance of yajñas. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply\ntake supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become\nmore and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of\ncreation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the\nlaws of material nature. A society of thieves can never be happy because they\nhave no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life.\nThey are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of\nhow to perform yajñas. Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest\nperformance of yajña, namely the saṅkīrtana-yajña, which can be performed\nby anyone in the world who accepts the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness."
