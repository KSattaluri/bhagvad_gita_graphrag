    "Sanskrit": "यज्ञशिष्टाशिनः सन्तो मुच्यन्ते सर्वकिल्बिषैः\nभुञ्जते ते त्वघं पापा ये पचन्त्यात्मकारणात् ॥ १३ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo\nmucyante sarva-kilbișaih\nbhuñjate te tv agham pāpā\nye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt",
    "Word_by_word": "yajña-śista—food taken after performance of yajña; aśinah—eaters; santah—\nthe devotees; mucyante—get relief from; sarva—all kinds of; kilbișaih—sins;\nbhuñjate—enjoy; te—they; tu—but; agham—grievous sins; pāpāḥ—sinners; ye\n—those; pacanti—prepare food; ātma-kāraṇāt—for sense enjoyment.",
    "Translation": "The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat\nfood which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for personal\nsense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.",
    "Purport": "The devotees of the Supreme Lord, or the persons who are in Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness, are called santas, and they are always in love with the Lord as it\nis described in the Brahma-samhitā: premāñjana- cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena\nsantah sadaiva hṛdayeșu vilokayanti. The santas, being always in a compact of\nlove with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda (the giver of all\npleasures), or Mukunda (the giver of liberation), or Kṛṣṇa (the all-attractive\nperson), cannot accept anything without first offering it to the Supreme\nPerson. Therefore, such devotees always perform yajñas in different modes of\ndevotional service, such as śravaņam, kīrtanam, smaraņam, arcanam, etc., and\nthese performances of yajñas keep them always aloof from all kinds of\ncontamination of sinful association in the material world. Others, who prepare\nfood for self or sense gratification, are not only thieves, but are also the eaters\nof all kinds of sins. How can a person be happy if he is both a thief and sinful?\nIt is not possible. Therefore, in order for people to become happy in all\nrespects, they must be taught to perform the easy process of sankīrtana-yajña,\nin full Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise, there can be no peace or happiness in\nthe world."
