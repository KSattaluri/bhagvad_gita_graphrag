    "Transliteration": "saha-yajñāḥ prajāḥ sṛṣṭvā\npurovāca prajāpatih\nanena prasaviṣyadhvam\neșa vo 'stv ișta-kāma-dhuk",
    "Word_by_word": "saha—along with; yajñāḥ—sacrifices; prajāḥ—generations; sṛṣṭvā—by creating; purā—anciently; uvāca—said; prajā-patiḥ—the Lord of creatures; anena—by this; prasaviṣyadhvam—be more and more prosperous; eșah—certainly; vah—your; astu—let it be; işta—all desirable; kāma-dhuk—bestower.",
    "Translation": "In the beginning of creation, the Lord of all creatures sent forth generations of men and demigods, along with sacrifices for Vişņu, and blessed them by saying, \"Be thou happy by this yajña [sacrifice] because its performance will bestow upon you all desirable things.\"",
    "Purport": "The material creation by the Lord of creatures (Vișņu) is a chance offered to the conditioned souls to come back home—back to Godhead. All living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gītā: vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyah. The Lord says that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said: patim viśvasyātmeśvaram. Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vişnu. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī describes the Lord as pati in so many ways:\nśriyah-patir yajña-patiḥ prajā-patir\ndhiyām patir loka-patir dharā-patih\npatir gatiś cāndhaka-vrsņi-sātvatām\nprasīdatām me bhagavān satām patiḥ\n(Bhāg. 2.4.20)\nThe prajā-pati is Lord Visņu, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all worlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this material world for the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yajñas (sacrifice) for the satisfaction of Visnu, so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety. Then after finishing the present material body, they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. By performance of yajña, the conditioned souls gradually become Krsna conscious and become godly in all respects. In this age of Kali, the sankīrtana-yajña (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. Sankīrtana-yajña and Kṛṣṇa consciousness go well together. Lord Krsna in His devotional form (as Lord Caitanya) is mentioned in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam as follows, with special reference to the sankīrtana-yajña:\nkṛṣṇa-varņam tviṣākṛṣṇām sāngopāngāstra-pārşadam\nyajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasah\n\"In this age of Kali, people who are endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of sankīrtana-yajña.” (Bhāg. 11.5.29) Other yajñas prescribed in the Vedic literatures are not easy to perform in this age of Kali, but the sankīrtana-yajña is easy and sublime for all purposes."
