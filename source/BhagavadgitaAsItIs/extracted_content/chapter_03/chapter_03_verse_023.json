    "Sanskrit": "यदि ह्यहं न वर्तेयं जातु कर्मण्यतन्द्रितः ।\nमम वर्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्याः पार्थ सर्वशः ॥ २३ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "yadi hy ahaṁ na varteyaṁ\njātu karmaṇy atandritaḥ\nmama vartmānuvartante\nmanuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ",
    "Word_by_word": "yadi—if; hi—certainly; aham—I; na—do not; varteyam—thus engage; jātu—ever; karmaṇi—in the performance of prescribed duties; atandritaḥ—with great care; mama—My; vartma—path; anuvartante—would follow; manuṣyāḥ—all men; pārtha—O son of Pṛthā; sarvaśaḥ—in all respects.",
    "Translation": "For, if I did not engage in work, O Pārtha, certainly all men would follow My path.",
    "Purport": "In order to keep the balance of social tranquility for progress in spiritual life, there are traditional family usages meant for every civilized man. Although such rules and regulations are for the conditioned souls and not Lord Kṛṣṇa, because He descended to establish the principles of religion, He followed the prescribed rules. Otherwise, common men would follow in His footsteps because He is the greatest authority. From the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is understood that Lord Kṛṣṇa was performing all the religious duties at home and out of home, as required of a householder."
