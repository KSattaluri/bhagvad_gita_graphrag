    "Sanskrit": "ये त्वेतदभ्यसूयन्तो नानुतिष्ठन्ति मे मतम् ।\nसर्वज्ञानविमूढांस्तान्विद्धि नष्टानचेतसः ॥ ३२ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "ye tv etad abhyasūyanto\nnānuṭiṣṭhanti me matam\nsarva-jñāna-vimūḍhāṁs tān\nviddhi naṣṭān acetasaḥ",
    "Word_by_word": "ye—those; tu—however; etat—this; abhyasūyantaḥ—out of envy; na—do not; anutiṣṭhanti—regularly perform; me—My; matam—injunction; sarva-jñāna—all sorts of knowledge; vimūḍhān—perfectly befooled; tān—they are; viddhi—know it well; naṣṭān—all ruined; acetasaḥ—without Kṛṣṇa consciousness.",
    "Translation": "But those who, out of envy, disregard these teachings and do not practice them regularly, are to be considered bereft of all knowledge, befooled, and doomed to ignorance and bondage.",
    "Purport": "The flaw of not being Kṛṣṇa conscious is clearly stated herein. As there is punishment for disobedience to the order of the supreme executive head, so there is certainly punishment for the disobedience of the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A disobedient person, however great he may be, is ignorant of his own self, of the Supreme Brahman, and Paramātmā and the Personality of Godhead, due to a vacant heart. Therefore there is no hope of perfection of life for him."
