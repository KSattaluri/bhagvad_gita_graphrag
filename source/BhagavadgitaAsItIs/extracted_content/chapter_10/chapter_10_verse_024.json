    "Word_by_word": "purodhasām — of all priests; ca — also; mukhyam — chief; mām — Me; viddhi — understand; pārtha — O son of Pṛthā; bṛhaspatim — Bṛhaspati; senānīnām — of all commanders; aham — I am; skandaḥ — Kārtikeya; sarasām — of all reservoirs of water; asmi — I am; sāgaraḥ — the ocean.",
    "Translation": "Of priests, O Arjuna, know Me to be the chief, Bṛhaspati, the lord of devotion. Of generals I am Skanda, the lord of war; and of bodies of water I am the ocean.",
    "Purport": "Indra is the chief demigod of the heavenly planets and is known as the king of the heavens. The planet in which he reigns is called Indraloka. Bṛhaspati is Indra's priest, and since Indra is the chief of all kings, Bṛhaspati is the chief of all priests. And as Indra is the chief of all kings, similarly Skanda, the son of Pārvatī and Lord Śiva, is the chief of all military commanders. And of all bodies of water, the ocean is the greatest. These representations of Krsna only give hints of His greatness."
