    "Sanskrit": "विस्तरेणात्मनो योगं विभूतिं च जनार्दन ।\nभूयः कथय तृप्तिर्हि शृण्वतो नास्ति मेऽमृतम् ॥ १८ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "vistareņātmano yogam\nvibhūtim ca janārdana\nbhūyaḥ kathaya trptir hi\nśrņvato nāsti me 'mrtam",
    "Word_by_word": "vistarena—in description; ātmanaḥ—of Yourself; yogam—mystic power; vibhūtim—opulences; ca—also; janārdana—O killer of the atheists; bhūyah— again; kathaya—describe; trptih—satisfaction; hi—certainly; śrņvatah— hearing; na asti—there is no; me—my; amrtam—nectar.",

And this nectar can be perceived by practical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories, but one never tires of hearing about Krsna. It is for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead.
