    "Sanskrit": "श्रीभगवानुवाच\nहन्त ते कथयिष्यामि दिव्या ह्यात्मविभूतयः ।\nप्राधान्यतः कुरुश्रेष्ठ नास्त्यन्तो विस्तरस्य मे ॥ १९ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nhanta te kathayiṣyāmi\ndivyā hy ātma-vibhūtayah\nprādhānyataḥ kuru-śrestha\nnāsty anto vistarasya me",
    "Word_by_word": "śrī bhagavān uvāca—the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; hanta—yes; te\n—unto you; kathayiṣyāmi—I shall speak; divyāḥ—divine; hi—certainly; ātma-\nvibhūtayaḥ—personal opulences; prādhānyataḥ—principally; kuruśreṣṭha—O\nbest of the Kurus; na asti—there is no; antaḥ—limit; vistarasya—to the\nextent; me—My.",
    "Translation": "The Blessed Lord said: Yes, I will tell you of My splendorous manifestations,\nbut only of those which are prominent, O Arjuna, for My opulence is limitless.",
    "Purport": "It is not possible to comprehend the greatness of Kṛṣṇa and His opulences.\nThe senses of the individual soul are imperfect and do not permit him to\nunderstand the totality of Kṛṣṇa's affairs. Still the devotees try to understand\nKṛṣṇa, but not on the principle that they will be able to understand Kṛṣṇa\nfully at any specific time or in any state of life. Rather, the very topics of\nKṛṣṇa are so relishable that they appear to them as nectar. Thus they enjoy\nthem. In discussing Kṛṣṇa's opulences and His diverse energies, the pure\ndevotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and\ndiscuss them. Kṛṣṇa knows that living entities do not understand the extent of\nHis opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations\nof His different energies. The word prādhānyataḥ (principal) is very important\nbecause we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme\nLord, for His features are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all.\nAnd vibhūti, as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls\nthe whole manifestation. In the Amara-kośa dictionary it is stated that vibhūti\nindicates an exceptional opulence.\nThe impersonalist or the pantheist cannot understand the exceptional\nopulences of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energy.\nBoth in the material world and in the spiritual world His energies are\ndistributed in every variety of manifestation. Now Kṛṣṇa is describing what\ncan be directly perceived by the common man; thus part of His variegated\nenergy is described in this way."
