    "Sanskrit": "जातस्य हि ध्रुवो मृत्युध्रुवं जन्म मृतस्य च ।\nतस्मादपरिहार्येऽर्थे न त्वं शोचितुमर्हसि ॥ २७ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "jātasya hi dhruvo mṛtyur\ndhruvaṁ janma mṛtasya ca\ntasmād aparihārye ’rthe\nna tvaṁ śocitum arhasi",
    "Word_by_word": "jātasya—one who has taken his birth; hi—certainly; dhruvah—a fact; mṛtyuh—death; dhruvam—it is also a fact; janma—birth; mṛtasya—of the dead; ca—also; tasmāt—therefore; aparihārye—for that which is unavoidable; arthe—in the matter of; na—do not; tvam—you; śocitum—to lament; arhasi—deserve.",
    "Translation": "For one who has taken his birth, death is certain; and for one who is dead, birth is certain. Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you should not lament.",
    "Purport": "One has to take birth according to one's activities of life. And, after finishing one term of activities, one has to die to take birth for the next. In this way the cycle of birth and death is revolving, one after the other without liberation. This cycle of birth and death does not, however, support unnecessary murder, slaughter and war. But at the same time, violence and war are inevitable factors in human society for keeping law and order.\nThe Battle of Kurukṣetra, being the will of the Supreme, was an inevitable event, and to fight for the right cause is the duty of a kṣatriya. Why should he be afraid of or aggrieved at the death of his relatives since he was discharging his proper duty? He did not deserve to break the law, thereby becoming subjected to the reactions of sinful acts, of which he was so afraid. By avoiding the discharge of his proper duty, he would not be able to stop the death of his relatives, and he would be degraded due to his selection of the wrong path of action."
