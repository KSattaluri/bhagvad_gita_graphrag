    "Sanskrit": "यततो ह्यपि कौन्तेय पुरुषस्य विपश्चितः ।\nइन्द्रियाणि प्रमाथीनि हरन्ति प्रसभं मनः ॥ ६० ॥",

    "Word_by_word": "yatatah—while endeavoring; hi—certainly; api—in spite of; kaunteya—O son of Kuntī; puruṣasya—of the man; vipaścitah—full of discriminating knowledge; indriyāņi—the senses; pramāthīni—stimulated; haranti—throws forcefully; prasabham—by force; manah—the mind.",
