    "Sanskrit": "यदा हि नेन्द्रियार्थेषु न कर्मस्वनुषज्जते ।\nसर्वसङ्कल्पसन्न्यासी योगारूढस्तदोच्यते ॥ ४॥",
    "Transliteration": "yadā hi nendriyārtheșu\nna karmasv anușajjate\nsarva-saṅkalpa-sannyāsī\nyogārūdhas tadocyate",
    "Word_by_word": "yadā—when; hi—certainly; na—not; indriya-artheșu—in sense gratification; na—never; karmasu—in fruitive activities; anușajjate—does necessarily engage; sarva-saṅkalpa—all material desires; sannyāsī—renouncer; yoga-ārūdhah—elevated in yoga; tadā—at that time; ucyate—is said to be.",
    "Translation": "A person is said to have attained to yoga when, having renounced all material desires, he neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive activities.",
    "Purport": "When a person is fully engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he is pleased in himself, and thus he is no longer engaged in sense gratification or in fruitive activities. Otherwise, one must be engaged in sense gratification, since one cannot live without engagement. Without Krsna consciousness, one must be always seeking self-centered or extended selfish activities. But a Krsna conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction of Krsna and thereby be perfectly detached from sense gratification. One who has no such realization must mechanically try to escape material desires before being elevated to the top rung of the yoga ladder."
