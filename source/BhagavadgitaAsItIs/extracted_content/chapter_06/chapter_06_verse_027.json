    "Sanskrit": "प्रशान्तमनसं ह्येनं योगिनं सुखमुत्तमम् ।\nउपैति शान्तरजसं ब्रह्मभूतमकल्मषम् ॥ २७ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "praśānta-manasam hy enam\nyoginam sukham uttamam\nupaiti śānta-rajasam\nbrahma-bhūtam akalmaşam",
    "Word_by_word": "praśānta—mind fixed on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa; manasam—of one whose mind is so fixed; hi—certainly; enam—this; yoginam—the yogī; sukham—happiness; uttamam—the highest; upaiti—attains; śānta-rajasam—pacified passion; brahma-bhūtam—liberated by identification with the Absolute; akalmaşam—freed from all past sinful reaction.",
    "Translation": "The yogi whose mind is fixed on Me verily attains the highest happiness. By virtue of his identity with Brahman, he is liberated; his mind is peaceful, his passions are quieted, and he is freed from sin.",
    "Purport": "Brahma-bhūta is the state of being free from material contamination and situated in the transcendental service of the Lord. Mad-bhaktim labhate parām (Bg. 18.54). One cannot remain in the quality of Brahman, the Absolute, until one's mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord. Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoh. To be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, or to remain in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is to be factually liberated from the mode of passion and all material contamination."
