    "Sanskrit": "यावत्सञ्जायते किञ्चित्सत्त्वं स्थावरजङ्गमम् ।\nक्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञसंयोगात्तद्विद्धि भरतर्षभ ॥ २७ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "yāvat sañjāyate kiñcit\nsattvam sthāvara-jaṅgamam\nkṣetra-kṣetrajña-saṁyogāt\ntad viddhi bharatarṣabha",
    "Word_by_word": "yāvat—whatever; sañjāyate—takes place; kiñcit—anything; sattvam—existence; sthāvara—not moving; jaṅgamam—moving; kṣetra—the body; kṣetrajña—knower of the body; saṁyogāt—union between; tat viddhi—you must know it; bharatarṣabha—O chief of the Bhāratas.",
    "Translation": "O chief of the Bhāratas, whatever you see in existence, both moving and unmoving, is only the combination of the field of activities and the knower of the field.",
    "Purport": "Both material nature and the living entity, which were existing before the creation of the cosmos, are explained in this verse. Whatever is created is but a combination of the living entity and material nature. There are many manifestations like trees, mountains and hills, which are not moving, and there are many existences which are moving, and all of them are but combinations of material nature and superior nature, the living entity. Without the touch of the superior nature, the living entity, nothing can grow. Therefore the relationship between matter and nature is eternally going on, and this combination is effected by the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the controller of both the superior and inferior natures. The material nature is created by Him, and the superior nature is placed in this material nature, and thus all these activities and manifestations take place."
