    "Sanskrit": "यस्य नाहंकृतो भावो बुद्धिर्यस्य न लिप्यते ।\nहत्वापि स इमाँलोकान्न हन्ति न निबध्यते ॥ १७ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "yasya nāhankṛto bhāvo\nbuddhir yasya na lipyate\nhatvāpi sa imāl lokān\nna hanti na nibadhyate",
    "Word_by_word": "yasya—of one who; na—never; ahankṛtaḥ—false ego; bhāvah—nature;\nbuddhiḥ—intelligence; yasya—one who; na—never; lipyate—is attached;\nhatvā api—even killing; saḥ—he; imān—this; lokān—world; na—never; hanti\n—kills; na—never; nibadhyate—becomes entangled.",
    "Translation": "One who is not motivated by false ego, whose intelligence is not entangled,\nthough he kills men in this world, is not the slayer. Nor is he bound by his\nactions.",
    "Purport": "In this verse the Lord informs Arjuna that the desire not to fight arises\nfrom false ego. Arjuna thought himself to be the doer of action, but he did not\nconsider the Supreme sanction within and without. If one does not know that\na super sanction is there, why should he act? But one who knows the\ninstrument of work, himself as the worker, and the Supreme Lord as the\nsupreme sanctioner, is perfect in doing everything. Such a person is never in\nillusion. Personal activity and responsibility arise from false ego and\ngodlessness, or a lack of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Anyone who is acting in Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness under the direction of the Supersoul or the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, even though killing, does not kill. Nor is he ever affected with the\nreaction of such killing. When a soldier kills under the command of a superior\nofficer, he is not subject to be judged. But if a soldier kills on his own personal\naccount, then he is certainly judged by a court of law."
