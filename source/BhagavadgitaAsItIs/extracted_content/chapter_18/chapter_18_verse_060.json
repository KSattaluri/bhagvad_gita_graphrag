    "Transliteration": "svabhāva-jena kaunteya\nnibaddhaḥ svena karmaṇā\nkartum necchasi yan mohāt\nkariṣyasy avaśo 'pi tat",
    "Word_by_word": "sva-bhāva-jena—by one's own nature; kaunteya—O son of Kuntī; nibaddhaḥ—conditioned; svena—by one's own; karmaṇā—activities; kartum—to do; na—not; icchasi—like; yat—that; mohāt—by illusion; kariṣyasi—you will act; avaśaḥ—imperceptibly; api—even; tat—that.",
    "Translation": "Under illusion you are now declining to act according to My direction. But, compelled by your own nature, you will act all the same, O son of Kunti.",
    "Purport": "If one refuses to act under the direction of the Supreme Lord, then he is compelled to act by the modes in which he is situated. Everyone is under the spell of a particular combination of the modes of nature and is acting in that way. But anyone who voluntarily engages himself under the direction of the Supreme Lord becomes glorious."
