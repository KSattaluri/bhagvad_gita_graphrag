    "Sanskrit": "कच्चिदेतच्छुतं पार्थ त्वयैकाग्रेण चेतसा ।\nकच्चिदज्ञानसम्मोहः प्रणष्टस्ते धनञ्जय ॥ ७२ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "kaccid etac chrutam pārtha\ntvayaikāgreṇa cetasā\nkaccid ajñāna-sammohaḥ\npraṇaṣṭas te dhanañjaya",
    "Word_by_word": "kaccit—whether; etat—this; śrutam—heard; pārtha—O son of Pṛthā; tvayā—by you; ekāgreṇa—with full attention; cetasā—by the mind; kaccit—whether; ajñāna—ignorant; sammohaḥ—illusion; praṇaṣṭaḥ—dispelled; te—of you; dhanañjaya—O conqueror of wealth (Arjuna).",
    "Translation": "O conqueror of wealth, Arjuna, have you heard this attentively with your mind? And are your illusions and ignorance now dispelled?",
    "Purport": "The Lord was acting as the spiritual master of Arjuna. Therefore it was His duty to inquire from Arjuna whether he understood the whole Bhagavad-gītā in its proper perspective. If not, the Lord was ready to re-explain any point, or the whole Bhagavad-gītā if so required. Actually, anyone who hears Bhagavad-gītā from a bona fide spiritual master like Kṛṣṇa or His representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled. Bhagavad-gītā is not an ordinary book written by a poet or fiction writer; it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Any person, if he is fortunate enough to hear these teachings from Kṛṣṇa or from His bona fide spiritual representative, is sure to become a liberated person and get out of the darkness of ignorance."
