    "Sanskrit": "न द्वेष्टयकुशलं कर्म कुशले नानुषज्जते ।\nत्यागी सत्त्वसमाविष्टो मेधावी छिन्नसंशयः ॥ १० ॥",
    "Transliteration": "na dveṣṭy akuśalam karma\nkuśale nānuṣajjate\ntyāgī sattva-samāviṣṭo\nmedhāvī chinna-saṁśayaḥ",
    "Word_by_word": "na—never; dveṣṭi—hates; akuśalam—inauspicious; karma—work; kuśale—in auspicious; na—nor; anuṣajjate—becomes attached; tyāgī—the renouncer; sattva—goodness; samāviṣṭaḥ—absorbed in; medhāvī—intelligent; chinna—cut up; saṁśayaḥ—all doubts.",
    "Translation": "Those who are situated in the mode of goodness, who neither hate inauspicious work nor are attached to auspicious work, have no doubts about work.",
    "Purport": "It is said in Bhagavad-gītā that one can never give up work at any time. Therefore he who works for Kṛṣṇa and does not enjoy the fruitive results, who offers everything to Kṛṣṇa, is actually a renouncer. There are many members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness who work very hard in their office or in the factory or some other place, and whatever they earn they give to the Society. Such highly elevated souls are actually sannyāsīs and are situated in the renounced order of life. It is clearly outlined here how to renounce the fruits of work and for what purpose fruits should be renounced."
