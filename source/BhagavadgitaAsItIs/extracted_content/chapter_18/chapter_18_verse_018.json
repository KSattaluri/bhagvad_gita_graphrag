    "Sanskrit": "ज्ञानं ज्ञेयं परिज्ञाता त्रिविधा कर्मचोदना ।\nकरणं कर्म कर्तेति त्रिविधः कर्मसङ्ग्रहः ॥ १८ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "jñānaṁ jñeyam parijñātā\ntri-vidhā karma-codanā\nkaraņam karma karteti\ntri-vidhaḥ karma-sangrahah",
    "Word_by_word": "jñānam—knowledge; jñeyam—objective; parijñātā—the knower; tri-vidhā—three kinds; karma—work; codanā—impetus; karaņam—the senses; karma—work; kartā—the doer; iti—thus; tri-vidhah—three kinds; karma—work; sangrahah—accumulation.",
    "Translation": "Knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower are the three factors which motivate action; the senses, the work and the doer comprise the threefold basis of action.",
    "Purport": "There are three kinds of impetus for daily work: knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower. The instruments of work, the work itself and the worker are called the constituents of work. Any work done by any human being has these elements. Before one acts, there is some impetus, which is called inspiration. Any solution arrived at before work is actualized is a subtle form of work. Then work takes the form of action. First one has to undergo the psychological processes of thinking, feeling and willing, and that is called impetus. Actually the faith to perform acts is called knowledge. The inspiration to work is the same if it comes from the scripture or from the instruction of the spiritual master. When the inspiration is there and the worker is there, then actual activity takes place by the help of the senses. The mind is the center of all senses, and the object is work itself. These are the different phases of work as described in Bhagavad-gītā. The sum total of all activities is called accumulation of work."
