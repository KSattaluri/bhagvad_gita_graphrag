    "Sanskrit": "अनपेक्षः शुचिर्दक्ष उदासीनो गतव्यथः ।\nसर्वारम्भपरित्यागी यो मद्भक्तः स मे प्रियः ॥ १६ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "anapekṣaḥ śucir dakṣa\nudāsīno gata-vyathaḥ\nsarvārambha-parityāgī\nyo mad-bhaktaḥ sa me priyaḥ",
    "Word_by_word": "anapekṣaḥ—neutral; śuciḥ—pure; dakṣaḥ—expert; udāsīnaḥ—free from care; gata-vyathaḥ—freed from all distress; sarva-ārambha—all endeavors; parityāgī—renouncer; yaḥ—anyone; mat-bhaktaḥ—My devotee; saḥ—he; me—Me; priyaḥ—very dear",
    "Translation": "A devotee who is not dependant on the ordinary course of activities, who is pure, expert, without cares, free from all pains, and who does not strive for some result, is very dear to Me.",
    "Purport": "Money may be offered to a devotee, but he should not struggle to acquire it. If automatically, by the grace of the Supreme, money comes to him, he is not agitated. Naturally a devotee takes bath at least twice in a day and rises early in the morning for devotional service. Thus he is naturally clean both inwardly and outwardly. A devotee is always expert because he fully knows the sense of all activities of life, and he is convinced of the authoritative scriptures. A devotee never takes the part of a particular party; therefore he is carefree. He is never pained because he is free from all designations; he knows that his body is a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free. The pure devotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of devotional service. For example, constructing a big building requires great energy, and a devotee does not take to such business if it does not benefit him by advancing his devotional service. He may construct a temple for the Lord, and for that he may take all kinds of anxiety, but he does not construct a big house for his personal relations."
