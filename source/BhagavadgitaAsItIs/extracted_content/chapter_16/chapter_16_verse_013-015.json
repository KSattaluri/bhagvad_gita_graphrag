    "Translation": "The demoniac person thinks: “So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain\nmore according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the\nfuture, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him; and my other\nenemy will also be killed. I am the lord of everything, I am the enjoyer, I am\nperfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic\nrelatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform\nsacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice.\" In this way, such\npersons are deluded by ignorance.",
