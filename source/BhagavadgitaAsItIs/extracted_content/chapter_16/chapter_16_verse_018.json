    "Sanskrit": "अहङ्कारं बलं दर्प कामं क्रोधं च संश्रिताः ।\nमामात्मपरदेहेषु प्रद्विषन्तोऽभ्यसूयकाः ॥ १८ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "ahaṁkāram balam darpam\nkāmam krodham ca saṁśritāḥ\nmām ātma-para-deheșu\npradvișanto 'bhyasūyakāḥ",
    "Word_by_word": "ahańkāram—false ego; balam—strength; darpam—pride; kāmam—lust;\nkrodham—anger; ca—also; samśritāḥ—having taken shelter of; mām—Me;\nātma—one's own; para-deheșu—in other bodies; pradvișantah—blasphemes;\nabhyasūyakāh—envious.",
    "Translation": "Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demon becomes\nenvious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in his own\nbody and in the bodies of others, and blasphemes against the real religion.",
    "Purport": "A demoniac person, being always against God's supremacy, does not like to\nbelieve in the scriptures. He is envious of both the scriptures and of the\nexistence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is caused by his so-\ncalled prestige and his accumulation of wealth and strength. He does not know\nthat the present life is a preparation for the next life. Not knowing this, he is\nactually envious of his own self, as well as of others. He commits violence on\nother bodies and on his own. He does not care for the supreme control of the\nPersonality of Godhead because he has no knowledge. Being envious of the\nscriptures and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he puts forward false\narguments against the existence of God and refutes the scriptural authority.\nHe thinks himself independant and powerful in every action. He thinks that\nsince no one can equal him in strength, power, or in wealth, he can act in any\nway and no one can stop him. If he has an enemy who might check the\nadvancement of his sensual activities, he makes plans to cut him down by his\nown power."
