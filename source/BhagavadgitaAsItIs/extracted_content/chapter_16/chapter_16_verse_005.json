    "Sanskrit": "दैवी सम्पद्विमोक्षाय निबन्धायासुरी मता ।\nमा श्रुचः सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातोऽसि पाण्डव ॥ ५ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "daivī sampad vimokṣāya\nnibandhāyāsurī matā |\nmā śucah sampadam daivīm\nabhijāto 'si pāṇḍava || 5 ||",
    "Word_by_word": "daivī—transcendental; sampat—nature; vimokṣāya—meant for liberation; nibandhāya—for bondage; āsurī—demoniac qualities; matā—it is considered; mā—do not; śucaḥ—worry; sampadam—nature; daivīm—transcendental; abhijātaḥ—born; asi—you are; pāṇḍava—O son of Pāṇḍu.",
    "Translation": "The transcendental qualities are conducive to liberation, whereas the demonic qualities make for bondage. Do not worry, O son of Pāṇḍu, for you are born with the divine qualities.",
    "Purport": "Lord Kṛṣṇa encouraged Arjuna by telling him that he was not born with demoniac qualities. His involvement in the fight was not demoniac because he was considering the pro’s and con’s. He was considering whether respectable persons such as Bhīṣma and Droṇa should be killed or not, so he was not acting under the influence of anger, false prestige, or harshness. Therefore he was not of the quality of the demons. For a kṣatriya, a military man, shooting arrows at the enemy is considered transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is demoniac. Therefore, there was no cause for Arjuna to lament. Anyone who performs the regulated principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally situated."
