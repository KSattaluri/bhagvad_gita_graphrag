    "Sanskrit": "काममाश्रित्य दुष्पूरं दम्भमानमदान्विताः ।\nमोहाद्गृहीत्वासद्‌ग्राहान्प्रवर्तन्तेऽश्रुचिव्रताः ॥ १० ॥",
    "Transliteration": "kāmam āśritya duşpūram\ndambha-māna-madānvitāḥ\nmohād gṛhītvāsad-grāhān\npravartante 'śuci-vratāḥ",
    "Word_by_word": "kāmam—lust; āśritya—taking shelter of; duşpūram—insatiable; dambha—pride; māna—false prestige; mada-anvitāḥ—absorbed in conceit; mohāt—by illusion; gṛhītvā—taking; asat—nonpermanent; grāhān—things; pravartante—flourish; aśuci—unclean; vratāḥ—avowed.",
    "Translation": "The demoniac, taking shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige, and being thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the impermanent.",
    "Purport": "The demoniac mentality is described here. The demons' lust is never satiated. They will go on increasing and increasing their insatiable desires for material enjoyment. Although they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting nonpermanent things, they still continue to engage in such activities out of illusion. They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong way. Accepting nonpermanent things, such demoniac people create their own God, create their own hymns and chant accordingly. The result is that they become more and more attracted to two things—sex enjoyment and accumulation of material wealth. The word aśuci-vratāḥ,\nunclean vow, is very significant in this connection. Such demoniac people are only attracted by wine, women, gambling and meat eating; those are their aśuci, unclean habits. Induced by pride and false prestige, they create some principles of religion which are not approved by the Vedic injunctions. Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the world, still, by artificial means, the world creates a false honor for them. Although they are gliding toward hell, they consider themselves very much advanced."
