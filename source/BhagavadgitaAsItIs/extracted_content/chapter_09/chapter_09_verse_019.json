    "Sanskrit": "तपाम्यहमहं वर्षं निगृह्णाम्युत्सृजामि च ।\nअमृतं चैव मृत्युश्च सदसच्चाहमर्जुन ॥ १९ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "tapāmy aham aham varṣaṁ\nnigṛhṇāmy utsṛjāmi ca |\namṛtaṁ caiva mṛtyuś ca\nsad asac cāham arjuna || 19 ||",
    "Word_by_word": "tapāmi—give heat; aham—I; aham—I; varṣam—rain; nigṛhṇāmi—withhold;\nutsṛjāmi—send forth; ca—and; amṛtam—immortality; ca—and; eva—\ncertainly; mṛtyuḥ—death; ca—and; sat—being; asat—nonbeing; ca—and;\naham—I; arjuna—O Arjuna.",
    "Translation": "O Arjuna, I control heat, the rain and the drought. I am immortality, and I am\nalso death personified. Both being and nonbeing are in Me.",
    "Purport": "Kṛṣṇa, by His different energies, diffuses heat and light through the agency\nof electricity and the sun. During summer season it is Kṛṣṇa who checks rain\nfrom falling from the sky, and then, during the rainy season, He gives\nunceasing torrents of rain. The energy which sustains us by prolonging the\nduration of our life is Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa meets us at the end as death. By\nanalyzing all these different energies of Kṛṣṇa, one can ascertain that for Kṛṣṇa\nthere is no distinction between matter and spirit, or, in other words, He is\nboth matter and spirit. In the advanced stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one does\nnot therefore make such distinctions. He sees Kṛṣṇa only in everything.\nSince Kṛṣṇa is both matter and spirit, the gigantic universal form comprising\nall material manifestations is also Kṛṣṇa, and His pastimes in Vṛndāvana as\ntwo-handed Śyāmasundara, playing on a flute, are those of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead."
