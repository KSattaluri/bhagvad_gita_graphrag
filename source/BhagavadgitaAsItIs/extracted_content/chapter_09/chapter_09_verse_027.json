    "Sanskrit": "यत्करोषि यदश्नासि यज्नुहोषि ददासि यत् । यत्तपस्यसि कौन्तेय तत्कुरुष्व मदर्पणम् ॥ २७ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "yat karoși yad aśnāsi yaj juhoși dadāsi yat yat tapasyasi kaunteya tat kurușva mad-arpanam",
    "Word_by_word": "yat—what; karoși—you do; yat—whatever; aśnāsi—you eat; yat—whatever; juhoși—you offer; dadāsi—you give away; yat—whatever; yat—whatever; tapasyasi—austerities you perform; kaunteya—O son of Kunti; tat—that; kurușva—make; mat—unto Me; arpanam—offering.",
    "Translation": "O son of Kuntī, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.",
    "Purport": "Thus, it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not forget Krsna in any circumstance. Everyone has to work for maintenance of his body and soul together, and Kṛṣṇa recommends herein that one should work for Him. Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore he should accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Krsna. Any civilized man has to perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore Kṛṣṇa recommends, \"Do it for Me,\" and this is called arcanā. Everyone has a tendency to give something in charity; Krsņa says, \"Give it to Me,\" and this means that all surplus money accummulated should be utilized in furthering the Krsna consciousness movement. Nowadays people are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not practical in this age, but if anyone practices meditating on Krsna twenty-four hours by chanting the Hare Krșņa mantra round his beads, he is surely the greatest yogī, as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā."
