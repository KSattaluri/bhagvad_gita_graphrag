    "Sanskrit": "महात्मानस्तु मां पार्थ दैवीं प्रकृतिमाश्रिताः ।\nभजन्त्यनन्यमनसो ज्ञात्वा भूतादिमव्ययम् ॥ १३ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha\ndaivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ\nbhajanty ananya-manaso\njñātvā bhūtādim avyayam",
    "Word_by_word": "mahātmānah—the great souls; tu—but; mām—unto Me; pārtha—O son of\nPṛthā; daivīm—divine; prakṛtim—nature; āśritāḥ—taken shelter of; bhajanti\n—render service; ananya-manasaḥ—without deviation of the mind; jñātvā—\nknowing; bhūta—creation; ādim—original; avyayam—inexhaustible.",
    "Translation": "O son of Pṛthā, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the\nprotection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service\nbecause they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and\ninexhaustible.",
    "Purport": "In this verse the description of mahātmā is clearly given. The first sign of\nthe mahātmā is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not under\nthe control of material nature. And how is this effected? That is explained in\nthe Seventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, at once becomes freed from the control of material\nnature. That is the qualification. One can become free from the control of\nmaterial nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. That is the preliminary formula. Being marginal potency, as soon as\nthe living entity is freed from the control of material nature, he is put under\nthe guidance of the spiritual nature. The guidance of the spiritual nature is\ncalled daivīm prakṛtim, divine nature. So, when one is promoted in that way—\nby surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead—one attains to the\nstage of great soul, mahātmā.\nThe mahātmā does not divert his attention to anything outside Kṛṣṇa because\nhe knows perfectly well that Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Person, the cause\nof all causes. There is no doubt about it. Such a mahātmā, or great soul,\ndevelops through association with other mahātmās, pure devotees. Pure\ndevotees are not even attracted by Kṛṣṇa's other features, such as the four-\narmed Mahā-Viṣṇu. They are simply attracted by the two-armed form of\nKṛṣṇa. Since they are not attracted to other features of Kṛṣṇa (what to speak\nof the demigods), they are not concerned with any form of a demigod or of a\nhuman being. They only meditate upon Kṛṣṇa in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They\nare always engaged in the unswerving service of the Lord in Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness."
