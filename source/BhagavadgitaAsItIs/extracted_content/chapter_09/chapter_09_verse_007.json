    "Sanskrit": "सर्वभूतानि कौन्तेय प्रकृतिं यान्ति मामिकाम् ।\nकल्पक्षये पुनस्तानि कत्पादौ विसृजाम्यहम् ॥ ७ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "sarva-bhūtāni kaunteya\nprakrtim yānti māmikām\nkalpa-kṣaye punas tāni\nkalpādau visṛjāmy aham",
    "Word_by_word": "sarva-bhūtāni—all created entities; kaunteya-O son of Kuntī; prakrtim—\nnature; yānti-enter; māmikām-unto Me; kalpa-kșaye-at the end of the\nmillennium; punaḥ-again; tāni—all those; kalpa-ādau—in the beginning of\nthe millennium; visṛjāmi—I create; aham—І.",
    "Translation": "O son of Kuntī, at the end of the millennium every material manifestation\nenters into My nature, and at the beginning of another millennium, by My\npotency I again create.",
    "Purport": "The creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material cosmic\nmanifestation is completely dependant on the supreme will of the Personality\nof Godhead. \"At the end of the millennium\" means at the death of Brahmā.\nBrahmā lives for one hundred years, and his one day is calculated at\n4,300,000,000 of our earthly years. His night is of the same duration. His\nmonth consists of thirty such days and nights, and his year of twelve months.\nAfter one hundred such years, when Brahmā dies, the devastation or\nannihilation takes place; this means that the energy manifested by the\nSupreme Lord is again wound up in Himself. Then again, when there is need\nto manifest the cosmic world, it is done by His will: \"Although I am one, I shall\nbecome many.\" This is the Vedic aphorism. He expands Himself in this\nmaterial energy, and the whole cosmic manifestation again takes place."
