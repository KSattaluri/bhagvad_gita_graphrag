    "Sanskrit": "भूमिरापोऽनलो वायुः खं मनो बुद्धिरेव च ।\nअहङ्कार इतीयं मे भिन्ना प्रकृतिरष्टधा ॥ ४ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ\nkham mano buddhir eva ca\nahańkāra itīyam me\nbhinnā prakṛtir aştadhā",
    "Word_by_word": "bhūmih—earth; āpah—water; analah—fire; vāyuḥ—air; kham—ether; manah\n—mind; buddhiḥ—intelligence; eva—certainly; ca—and; ahankāraḥ—false\nego; iti—thus; iyam—all these; me—My; bhinnā—separated; prakrtih—\nenergies; aștadhā—total eight.",
    "Translation": "Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego—altogether these\neight comprise My separated material energies.",
    "Purport": "The science of God analyzes the constitutional position of God and His\ndiverse energies. Material nature is called prakrti, or the energy of the Lord in\nHis different puruşa incarnations (expansions) as described in the Svatvata\nTantra:\nvișņos tu trīņi rūpāņi puruṣākhyāny atho viduh\nekantu mahataḥ sraștr dvitīyam tv anda-samsthitam\ntrtīyaṁ sarvabhūta-stham tāni jñātvā vimucyate\n\"For material creation, Lord Kṛṣṇa's plenary expansion assumes three\nVisņus. The first one, Mahā-Visņu, creates the total material energy, known as\nmahat-tattva. The second, Garbhodakaśāyī Vișņu, enters into all the universes\nto create diversities in each of them. The third, Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, is\ndiffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as\nParamātmā, who is present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these\nthree Visņus can be liberated from material entanglement.\"\nThis material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of\nthe Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three\nVisņu expansions of Lord Kṛṣṇa. These Purușas are called incarnations.\nGenerally one who does not know the science of God (Kṛṣṇa) assumes that\nthis material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the\nliving entities are the causes (Purușas), controllers and enjoyers of the\nmaterial energy. According to Bhagavad-gītā this atheistic conclusion is false.\nIn the verse under discussion it is stated that Krsna is the original cause of the\nmaterial manifestation. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also confirms this. The\ningredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord.\nEven the brahmajyoti, which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a\nspiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual\ndiversities in brahmajyoti as there are in the Vaikunthalokas, and the\nimpersonalist accepts this brahmajyoti as the ultimate eternal goal. The\nParamātmā manifestation is also a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the\nKṣīrodakaśāyī Visņu. The Paramātmā manifestation is not eternal in the\nspiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead Krsna. He is the complete energetic person, and He\npossesses different separated and internal energies.\nIn the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above\nmentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water,\nfire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations,\nwithin which the five sense objects are included. They are the manifestations\nof physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises\nthese ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind,\nintelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists. Philosophers who\ndeal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do\nnot know the ultimate source, Kṛṣṇa. The false ego—\"I am,\" and \"It is mine,\"\nwhich constitute the basic principle of material existence—includes ten sense\norgans for material activities. Intelligence refers to the total material creation,\ncalled the mahat-tattva. Therefore from the eight separated energies of the\nLord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are\nthe subject matter of sānkhya atheistic philosophy; they are originally\noffshoots from Krsna's energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic\nsānkhya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know Krsna as the\ncause of all causes. The subject matter for discussion in the sānkhya philosophy\nis only the manifestation of the external energy of Krsna, as it is described in\nthe Bhagavad-gītā."
