    "Sanskrit": "अव्यक्तं व्यक्तिमापन्नं मन्यन्ते मामबुद्धयः ।\nपरं भावमजानन्तो ममाव्ययमनुत्तमम् ॥ २४ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "avyaktam vyaktim āpannam\nmanyante mām abuddhayah\nparam bhāvam ajānanto\nmamāvyayam anuttamam",
    "Word_by_word": "avyaktam—nonmanifested; vyaktim—personality; āpannam—achieved;\nmanyante—think; mām—unto Me; abuddhayah—less intelligent persons;\nparam—supreme; bhāvam—state of being; ajānantah—without knowing;\nmama—My; avyayam—imperishable; anuttamam—the finest.",
    "Translation": "Unintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form and\npersonality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature,\nwhich is changeless and supreme.",
    "Purport": "Those who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less\nintelligent persons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described. Lord\nKṛṣṇa in His personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to\nignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form.\nYāmunācārya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession from\nRāmānujācārya, has written two very appropriate verses in this connection.\nHe says, \"My dear Lord, devotees like Vyāsadeva and Nārada know You to be\nthe Personality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one\ncan come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and\none can thus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nBut those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the\nnondevotees, cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You.\nHowever expert such nondevotees may be in discussing Vedānta and the\nUpaniṣads and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to\nunderstand the Personality of Godhead.\"\nIn the Brahma-samhitā it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be\nunderstood simply by study of the Vedānta literature. Only by the mercy of the\nSupreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this\nverse it is clearly stated that not only the worshipers of the demigods are less\nintelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Vedānta and\nspeculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true Kṛṣṇa consciousness\nare also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God's\npersonal nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute\nTruth is impersonal are described as asuras, which means one who does not\nknow the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it\nis stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and\nthen rises to the localized Supersoul—but the ultimate word in the Absolute\nTruth is the Personality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less\nintelligent, for they do not even follow their great predecessor, Śańkarācārya,\nwho has specifically stated that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nImpersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think Kṛṣṇa to be\nonly the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity.\nThis is also condemned in Bhagavad-gītā: \"Only the fools regard Me as an\nordinary person.\" The fact is that no one can understand Krsna without\nrendering devotional service and without developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nThe Gītā confirms this.\nOne cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, or His\nform, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic\nliterature. One must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully\nengaged in Krsna consciousness, beginning by chanting the\nmahāmantra—Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Krsna, Krsna Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma,\nHare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare—then only can one understand the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think that Krsna\nhas a body made of this material nature and that all His activities, His form\nand everything, are māyā. These impersonalists are known as Māyāvādī. They\ndo not know the ultimate truth.\nThe twentieth verse clearly states: \"Those who are blinded by lusty desires\nsurrender unto the different demigods.\" It is accepted that besides the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their different planets\n(Bg. 7.23), and the Lord also has a planet. It is also stated that the worshipers\nof the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are\ndevotees of Lord Krsna go to the Kṛṣṇaloka planet. Although this is clearly\nstated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and\nthat these forms are impositions. From the study of the Gītā does it appear that\nthe demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods\nnor Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all\npersons; Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His\nown planet, and the demigods theirs.\nTherefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that\nform is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not\nimposed. From the Gītā we can clearly understand that the forms of the\ndemigods and the form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and\nthat Lord Kṛṣṇa is sac-cid-ānanda, eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedas also\nconfirm that the Supreme Absolute Truth is ānandamaya, or full of blissful\npleasure, and that He is abhyāsāt, by nature the reservoir of unlimited\nauspicious qualities. And in the Gītā the Lord says that although He is aja\n(unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we should understand from\nthe Gītā. We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead\ncan be impersonal; the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist is false as\nfar as the statements of the Gītā are concerned. It is clear herein that the\nSupreme Absolute Truth, Lord Krsna, has both form and personality."
