    "Sanskrit": "मनुष्याणां सहस्त्रेषु कश्चिद्यतति सिद्धये ।\nयततामपि सिद्धानां कश्चिन्मां वेत्ति तत्त्वतः ॥ ३ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreșu\nkaścid yatati siddhaye\nyatatām api siddhānām\nkaścin māṁ vetti tattvatah",
    "Word_by_word": "manuṣyānām—of men; sahasreșu—out of many thousands; kaścit—someone;\nyatati endeavors; siddhaye—for perfection; yatatām—of those so\nendeavoring; api—indeed; siddhānām—of those who have achieved\nperfection; kaścit—someone; mām—Me; vetti—does know; tattvatah—in fact.",
    "Translation": "Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of\nthose who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.",
    "Purport": "There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands one may be\nsufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the\nself, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is\nsimply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending\nand mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The\nfirst six chapters of the Gītā are meant for those who are interested in\ntranscendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the\nprocess of realization by jñāna-yoga, dhyāna-yoga, and discrimination of the\nself from matter. However, Kṛṣṇa can only be known by persons who are in\nKrsņa consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal\nBrahman realization, for this is easier than understanding Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the\nSupreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman\nand Paramātmā. The yogīs and jñānīs are confused in their attempts to\nunderstand Krșņa, although the greatest of the impersonalists, Śrīpāda\nŚankarācārya, has admitted in his Gītā commentary that Krsna is the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. But his followers do not accept Krsna as such, for it is\nvery difficult to know Kṛṣṇa, even though one has transcendental realization\nof impersonal Brahman.\nKṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the\nprimeval Lord Govinda. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahah\nanādir ādir govindaḥ sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam. It is very difficult for the\nnondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of\nbhakti or devotional service is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of\nbhakti is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they\ntake up the difficult path? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy. The so-called\npath of bhakti practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti\nmay be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and\nregulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path.\nŚrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī writes in his Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu:\nśruti-smrti-purāṇādi-pañcarātra-vidhim vinā\naikāntikī harer bhaktir utpātāyaiva kalpate.\n\"Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic\nliteratures like the Upaniṣads, Purāṇas, Nārada-pañcarātra, etc., is simply an\nunnecessary disturbance in society.\"\nIt is not possible for the Brahman realized impersonalist or the Paramātmā\nrealized yogī to understand Krsna the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the\nson of mother Yaśodā or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are\nsometimes confused about Krsna: “muhyanti yat sūrayah,” “mām tu veda na\nkaścana.\" \"No one knows Me as I am,” the Lord says. And if one does know\nHim, then “sa mahātmā sudurlabhah.” “Such a great soul is very rare.\"\nTherefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, he cannot know\nKṛṣṇa as He is (tattvataḥ), even though he is a great scholar or philosopher.\nOnly the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable\ntranscendental qualities in Kṛṣṇa, in the cause of all causes, in His\nomnipotence and opulence, and in His wealth, fame, strength, beauty,\nknowledge and renunciation, because Kṛṣṇa is benevolently inclined to His\ndevotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone\ncan realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:\nataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyāih\nsevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adah\n\"No one can understand Krsna as He is by the blunt material senses. But He\nreveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their\ntranscendental loving service unto Him.\" (Padma Purāṇa)"
