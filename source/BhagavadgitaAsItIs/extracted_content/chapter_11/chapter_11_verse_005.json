    "Sanskrit": "श्रीभगवानुवाच\nपश्य मे पार्थ रूपाणि शतशोऽथ सहस्रशः ।\nनानाविधानि दिव्यानि नानावर्णाकृतीनि च ॥ ५ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "śrī-bhagavān uvāca\npaśya me pārtha rūpāņi\nśataśo 'tha sahasraśaḥ\nnānā-vidhāni divyāni\nnānā-varņākṛtīni ca",
    "Word_by_word": "śrī bhagavān uvāca—the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; paśya—just see; me—Mine; pārtha—O son of Pṛthā; rūpāņi—forms; śataśaḥ—hundreds; atha—also; sahasraśaḥ—thousands; nānā-vidhāni—variegated; divyāni— divine; nānā—variegated; varna—colored; akṛtīni—forms; ca—also.",
    "Translation": "The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, O son of Pṛthā, behold now My opulences, hundreds of thousands of varied divine forms, multicolored like the sea.",
    "Purport": "Arjuna wanted to see Kṛṣṇa in His universal form, which, although a transcendental form, is just manifested for the cosmic manifestation and is therefore subject to the temporary time of this material nature. As the material nature is manifested and not manifested, similarly this universal form of Kṛṣṇa is manifested and unmanifested. It is not eternally situated in the spiritual sky like Kṛṣṇa's other forms. As far as a devotee is concerned, he is not eager to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted to see Kṛṣṇa in this way, Kṛṣṇa reveals this form. This universal form is not possible to be seen by any ordinary man. Kṛṣṇa must give one the power to see it."
