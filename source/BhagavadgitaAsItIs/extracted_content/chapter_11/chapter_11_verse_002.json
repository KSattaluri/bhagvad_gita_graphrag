    "Sanskrit": "भवाप्ययौ हि भूतानां श्रुतौ विस्तरशो मया ।\nत्वत्तः कमलपत्राक्ष माहात्म्यमपि चाव्ययम् ॥ २ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "bhavāpyayau hi bhūtānām\nśrutau vistaraśo mayā\ntvattah kamala-patrākṣa\nmāhātmyam api cāvyayam",
    "Word_by_word": "bhava—appearance; apyayau—disappearance; hi—certainly; bhūtānām—of all living entities; śrutau—have heard; vistaraśah—detail; mayā—by me; tvattah—from You; kamala-patrākṣa—O lotus-eyed one; māhātmyam—glories; api—also; ca—and; avyayam—inexhaustible.",
    "Translation": "O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and disappearance of every living entity, as realized through Your inexhaustible glories.",
    "Purport": "Arjuna addresses Lord Krsņa as \"lotus-eyed\" (Krsna's eyes appear just like the petals of a lotus flower) out of his joy, for Krsna has assured him, in the last verse of the previous chapter, that He sustains the entire universe with just a fragment of Himself. He is the source of everything in this material manifestation, and Arjuna has heard of this from the Lord in detail. Arjuna further knows that in spite of His being the source of all appearances and disappearances, He is aloof from them. His personality is not lost, although He is all-pervading. That is the inconceivable opulence of Krsna which Arjuna admits that he has thoroughly understood."
