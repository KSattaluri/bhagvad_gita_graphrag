    "Sanskrit": "श्रेयान्द्रव्यमयाद्यज्ञाज्ज्ञानयज्ञः परन्तप ।\nसर्वं कर्माखिलं पार्थ ज्ञाने परिसमाप्यते ॥ ३३ ॥",
    "Transliteration": "śreyān dravya-mayād yajñāj\njñāna-yajñaḥ parantapa\nsarvam karmākhilam pārtha\njñāne parisamāpyate",
    "Word_by_word": "śreyān—greater; dravyamayāt—than the sacrifice of material possessions;\nyajñāt—knowledge; jñāna-yajñaḥ—sacrifice in knowledge; parantapa—O\nchastiser of the enemy; sarvam—all; karma—activities; akhilam—in totality;\npārtha—O son of Pṛthā; jñāne—in knowledge; parisamāpyate—ends in.",
    "Translation": "O chastiser of the enemy, the sacrifice of knowledge is greater than the sacrifice\nof material possessions. O son of Pṛthā, after all, the sacrifice of work\nculminates in transcendental knowledge.",
    "Purport": "The purpose of all sacrifices is to arrive at the status of complete\nknowledge, then to gain release from material miseries, and, ultimately, to\nengage in loving transcendental service to the Supreme Lord (Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness). Nonetheless, there is a mystery about all these different\nactivities of sacrifice, and one should know this mystery. Sacrifices sometimes\ntake different forms according to the particular faith of the performer. When\none's faith reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, the performer of\nsacrifices should be considered more advanced than those who simply sacrifice\nmaterial possessions without such knowledge, for without attainment of\nknowledge, sacrifices remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual\nbenefit. Real knowledge culminates in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the highest stage\nof transcendental knowledge. Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices\nare simply material activities. When, however, they are elevated to the level of\ntranscendental knowledge, all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform.\nDepending on differences in consciousness, sacrificial activities are sometimes\ncalled karma-kāṇḍa, fruitive activities, and sometimes jñāna-kāṇḍa, knowledge\nin the pursuit of truth. It is better when the end is knowledge."
